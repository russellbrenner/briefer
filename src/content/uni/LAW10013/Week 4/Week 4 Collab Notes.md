# Week 4 – International Sales Contracts (Part 2): The UNIDROIT Principles
*Subject: LAW10013 – Commercial Law*
*Lecturer: Nick Nicolopoulos*
*Date: TP2 2025*
*Materials: Transcript only*

## Overview

**Topic Summary**
This week introduced the *UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts* (‘UPICC’) and their use in interpreting, supplementing, or even governing international commercial agreements, especially where the *CISG* (Vienna Convention) does not apply or is silent. The UPICC are non-legislative, soft law instruments developed by the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT), providing a harmonised set of rules for cross-border commercial contracts. The class focused on the function of the UPICC as lex mercatoria, their non-binding nature unless agreed to, and the Rechtbank Amsterdam case study regarding COVID-19 and contract enforcement.

## Key Concepts and Legal Doctrines

### 1. UNIDROIT Principles – Purpose and Nature
**Definition / Scope**
The *UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts* (UPICC) are non-binding, internationally recognised rules designed to harmonise cross-border commercial contract law. They are drafted by scholars and practitioners, not legislatures.

**Application**
- Supplement the CISG where it is silent
- Used when parties choose “general principles of international commercial law”
- Applicable where parties opt out of national laws but do not specify a substitute legal regime

**Legal Character**
- Soft law (not binding unless expressly adopted)
- Can be referred to in arbitration, mediation, or litigation
- Sometimes invoked as lex mercatoria (the ‘law of merchants’)

**Lecturer Notes**
- Described as offering predictability, consistency, and procedural fairness across jurisdictions
- Applicable to contract formation, performance, non-performance, remedies, agency, etc. [oai_citation:0‡LAW20009 Collab Transcript Week 4.txt](file-service://file-CTutvsyJAEN9rGAoyxGMyA)

### 2. Functions and Key Principles
**Core Values**
- Good faith and fair dealing
- Cooperation in performance
- Uniform application of contract terms
- Recognition of trade usages and commercial practices
- Authority of agents and their ability to bind principals

**Scope of Coverage**
- Agency
- Remedies (including force majeure, hardship)
- Contract interpretation
- Supply chains and third-party involvement
- Arbitration/litigation where forum law is uncertain

**Lecturer Notes**
- Emphasised their practical importance in contexts such as supply disruption, agency-based sales, or third-party logistics (e.g. DHL)
- Principles support clarity in multinational transactions even where formal law is vague or jurisdictional boundaries unclear [oai_citation:1‡LAW20009 Collab Transcript Week 4.txt](file-service://file-CTutvsyJAEN9rGAoyxGMyA)

### 3. Legal Framework and Dispute Resolution
**Agency Rules**
- Recognise that agents can bind principals by express or implied authority
- Useful where companies operate via local distributors rather than direct personnel

**Arbitration vs Mediation**
- Arbitration is binding, often selected under UPICC as preferred resolution mechanism
- Mediation is consensual and non-binding

**UPICC and Private International Law**
- Often used where parties wish to avoid choosing a national law
- Provide a default framework under ‘general principles of international commercial law’

**Lex Mercatoria**
- A broader term under which UPICC may fall
- Allows parties to agree on transnational legal norms instead of national systems

## IRAC Case Summaries

### Case: *Rechtbank Amsterdam* (30 April 2020)

| Element     | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Issue**   | Whether a letter of intent was enforceable as a binding contract during COVID-19 |
| **Rule**    | Parties can opt out of national law and adopt UPICC; enforceability depends on intent and external circumstances |
| **Application** | Dutch company failed to follow through on acquiring 50% stake in US company. Letter of intent included a €30M penalty clause. COVID-19 cited as an external impediment |
| **Conclusion**  | Court found no enforceable contract. No obligation to proceed or pay the penalty clause |
| **Ratio**   | UPICC used to interpret parties' intentions and assess fairness during unprecedented events; pandemic was not foreseeable and impacted performance capacity [oai_citation:2‡LAW20009 Collab Transcript Week 4.txt](file-service://file-CTutvsyJAEN9rGAoyxGMyA)

## Worked Examples

### Problem: COVID-19 Supply Chain Disruption
**Facts**
A seller in Country A agrees to deliver cars to a buyer in Country B. Transit is delayed indefinitely due to a blockade (e.g. Suez Canal). Buyer sues for breach.

**Issue(s)**
- Is the non-performance excused by a force majeure clause or hardship principles under UPICC?
- Can buyer seek damages or termination?

**Lecturer’s Reasoning**
- Such blockades may fall under force majeure/hardship provisions
- If beyond seller’s control and unforeseeable, performance may be excused
- Remedies may depend on how the parties drafted their agreement

**Answer Summary**
✓ Delay likely excused under UPICC hardship/force majeure principles
✓ Buyer must consider third-party performance limitations
✓ Remedy may include suspension or renegotiation, not necessarily termination [oai_citation:3‡LAW20009 Collab Transcript Week 4.txt](file-service://file-CTutvsyJAEN9rGAoyxGMyA)

## Practical Exam and Study Tips

**IRAC Structuring**
- Identify whether parties have opted into UPICC or lex mercatoria
- Assess enforceability of pre-contractual instruments (e.g. letter of intent)
- Use UPICC to evaluate good faith, cooperation, and agency-related issues
- Distinguish between binding obligations and guiding principles

**Memory Aids / Mnemonics**
- FAIR: *Fair dealing*, *Agency*, *International principles*, *Remedies*
- GHOST: *Good faith*, *Hardship*, *Obligations*, *Soft law*, *Third parties*

**Warnings**
- Do not treat UPICC as legislation unless expressly adopted
- Avoid assuming letters of intent are enforceable
- Force majeure requires unforeseeability + actual impediment
