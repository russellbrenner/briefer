# Week 1 – Introductory Matters and Relevance  
*Subject: LAW20009 – Evidence Law*  
*Lecturer: Alana Ray*  
*Date: [Insert Date if known]*  
*Materials: Transcript + Slides*

## Overview

**Topic Summary**  
Week 1 introduces the foundational principles of the law of evidence. The lecture covers the meaning of “evidence” and how it differs from “proof”, the structure and purpose of the *Evidence Act 2008 (Vic)*, and the centrality of s 55 which defines the threshold of relevance. Students are introduced to facts in issue, how to categorise them, and the logical connection test that determines admissibility. Relevance is framed as the gateway to admissibility, and the importance of inference over speculation is emphasised through doctrinal authority and practical examples.

## Key Concepts and Legal Doctrines

### 1. Evidence vs Proof  
**Definition / Scope**  
Evidence refers to information presented to the court to assist in determining facts in issue. It is not inherently determinative. Proof is the final legal conclusion a court draws after considering the totality of evidence.

**Elements / Test**  
- Evidence is raw information (e.g. testimony, documents, objects)  
- Proof is the court’s acceptance of the truth or falsity of a fact  
- Evidence does not equal proof  
- Proof results from fact-finder belief in the evidence

**Authorities**  
- *Wells*, cited in Anderson et al  
  > *“I have proved such and such a fact” means “I have led evidence of this fact: I hope the court will accept and act upon it”.*

**Lecturer Notes**  
- Flour ≠ bread: evidence must be processed into proof  
- Misunderstanding this distinction leads to poor analysis

---

### 2. Relevance – s 55 *Evidence Act 2008 (Vic)*  
**Definition / Scope**  
Under s 55(1), evidence is relevant if, if accepted, it could rationally affect the probability of a fact in issue.

**Elements / Test**  
- Must affect *assessment of probability*  
- Relevance must be to a *fact in issue*  
- Threshold is *very low*  
- Must involve *logical connection*  
- May be direct or circumstantial

**Authorities**  
- *Papakosmas v The Queen* (1999) 196 CLR 297  
  > *“Reliability is not the concern of relevance”* — McHugh J

- *Festa v The Queen* (2001) 208 CLR 593  
  > *“Not enough to say evidence is weak... admissibility depends on logical connection, not strength”* — Gleeson CJ

**Lecturer Notes**  
- Always start with s 55 before assessing admissibility  
- “Could rationally affect” = minimal logical link  
- Weak evidence ≠ irrelevant evidence

---

### 3. Admissibility – s 56 *Evidence Act 2008 (Vic)*  
**Definition / Scope**  
Once evidence passes the relevance test, it is prima facie admissible under s 56(1), unless otherwise excluded.

**Elements / Test**  
- Relevant evidence is admissible unless excluded  
- Irrelevant evidence is not admissible (s 56(2))  
- Relevance is *necessary but not sufficient*

**Lecturer Notes**  
- Think of s 55 as a metal detector  
- Think of s 56 as the checkpoint – even if you pass, other rules can still exclude you (e.g. ss 135–137)

---

### 4. Facts in Issue  
**Definition / Scope**  
Facts in issue are the legally material facts that one party must prove and the other may dispute. They are essential to resolving the case.

**Categories**  
- **Ultimate facts**: Core legal elements of the claim/charge/defence  
- **Primary facts**: Factual observations that support or disprove ultimate facts  
- **Intermediate facts**: Inferences drawn from primary facts to establish ultimate facts

**Authorities**  
- *Smith v The Queen* (2001) 206 CLR 650  
  > *“Ultimate issues will be expressed in terms of the elements of the offence…”*

- *Goldsmith v Sandilands* (2002) 76 ALJR 1024  
  > *“Facts in issue reflect the material facts that constitute the claimant's cause of action…”*

**Lecturer Notes**  
- Always identify the facts in issue before applying the test in s 55  
- In criminal matters, look to the elements of the charge  
- In civil matters, pleadings define the facts in issue

## IRAC Case Summaries

### Case: *Smith v The Queen* (2001) 206 CLR 650

| Element     | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Issue**   | Whether police identification evidence was relevant under s 55. |
| **Rule**    | Evidence is relevant if it could rationally affect the probability of a fact in issue. |
| **Application** | Police recognised the accused from prior interactions and said he appeared in robbery photos. However, the jury saw both the accused and the photos themselves. The officers added no new or expert insight. |
| **Conclusion**  | Evidence inadmissible — jury was in no worse a position than the officers to assess similarity. |
| **Ratio**   | Where the jury has access to the same evidence as the witness, no logical connection arises. Identification evidence is irrelevant when the jury is equally equipped to form its own conclusion. |

### Case: *Goldsmith v Sandilands* (2002) 76 ALJR 1024

| Element     | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Issue**   | How are facts in issue identified in a civil case? |
| **Rule**    | Material facts are those pleaded in support of a cause of action or defence. |
| **Application** | The claimant pleaded causes of action and the respondent's defence disputed key matters. The High Court confirmed that only those issues pleaded and denied formed the factual issues. |
| **Conclusion**  | Only pleaded facts that are material to outcome and in dispute become facts in issue. |
| **Ratio**   | The court will consider only facts raised in pleadings and denied by the other party to determine relevance under s 55. |

### Case: *Papakosmas v The Queen* (1999) 196 CLR 297

| Element     | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Issue**   | Whether prior consistent statements from sexual assault complainants were relevant. |
| **Rule**    | Relevance is assessed independently of reliability. If the statement, if believed, could rationally affect a fact in issue, it is relevant. |
| **Application** | The prosecution relied on the complainants’ statements made shortly after the alleged assaults. Defence challenged their reliability. The High Court held relevance is not determined by strength or truth, but by potential logical connection. |
| **Conclusion**  | The statements were admissible under s 55. |
| **Ratio**   | Relevance focuses on logical connection, not evidentiary strength. Reliability may affect weight, but not threshold admissibility. |

### Case: *Festa v The Queen* (2001) 208 CLR 593

| Element     | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Issue**   | Whether weak identification evidence (by police) was admissible. |
| **Rule**    | Weak evidence is not the same as irrelevant evidence; admissibility depends on relevance, not weight. |
| **Application** | A police officer gave identification evidence based on limited familiarity with the accused. Although the evidence was not strong, it had some probative value. |
| **Conclusion**  | The evidence was admissible; weight was a matter for the jury. |
| **Ratio**   | Weak evidence can still be relevant. The strength of a connection affects weight, not admissibility. Judges should not exclude weak but logically connected evidence. |

### Case: *R v Falzon* (2018) 262 CLR 218

| Element     | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Issue**   | Was the presence of $120,000 in cash admissible as evidence of drug trafficking? |
| **Rule**    | Circumstantial evidence is relevant if it contributes to a reasonable inference of a fact in issue. |
| **Application** | The High Court found the cash, in combination with other factors (plants at multiple properties), supported an inference of commercial drug trafficking. |
| **Conclusion**  | The cash evidence was admissible. |
| **Ratio**   | Circumstantial evidence must be considered cumulatively; each piece adds context and weight to the inference. A single weak point does not preclude relevance. |

### Case: *R v Ryan* (1967) 121 CLR 205

| Element     | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Issue**   | Whether a complainant’s distress supported an inference of non-consensual sexual activity. |
| **Rule**    | Inference may be drawn if human experience shows a sufficient connection between fact A (distress) and fact B (lack of consent). |
| **Application** | Court accepted that distress shortly after the alleged incident aligned with lack of consent. However, noted other possible explanations existed. |
| **Conclusion**  | Inference permitted; jury should be directed on limits of such inference. |
| **Ratio**   | Courts must distinguish inference from speculation. Inference must be grounded in a pattern of human experience, even if it’s not determinative. |

### Case: *Clay v The Queen* [2006] VSCA 80

| Element     | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Issue**   | Whether bedwetting was relevant to the question of sexual abuse. |
| **Rule**    | Behavioural evidence must be supported by expert testimony where it depends on specialised psychological knowledge. |
| **Application** | No expert was called to explain the relationship between bedwetting and trauma. The court held that inferences drawn without expert evidence were speculative. |
| **Conclusion**  | Evidence was inadmissible. |
| **Ratio**   | Where an inference requires expert knowledge, the failure to provide such a foundation will render it speculative and inadmissible. |

### Case: *Radi v The Queen* [2020] VSCA 34

| Element     | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Issue**   | Whether bullets found in the defendant’s vehicle were relevant to drug trafficking charges. |
| **Rule**    | Evidence is relevant if it could rationally affect the assessment of whether the defendant had intent to traffic. |
| **Application** | Bullets were argued to indicate firearm possession, which in turn indicated preparation for drug supply — a common association in drug operations. |
| **Conclusion**  | Evidence was admissible. |
| **Ratio**   | The presence of weapons (or related items) may be circumstantial evidence of intent to traffic; relevance upheld if part of a wider inferential chain. |

## Worked Examples

### Problem: The Bullet Box (*Radi v The Queen*)

**Facts**  
Police discovered 991 grams of methylamphetamine in the front seat of the defendant’s vehicle, and a box of bullets in the passenger door. No firearm was found. The prosecution sought to rely on the bullets as evidence of intent to traffic.

**Issue(s)**  
- Could the bullets support the inference that the defendant intended to traffic drugs?

**Lecturer’s Reasoning**  
- Section 55 test applied: Would the presence of bullets, if accepted, make it more probable that the accused was involved in drug supply?  
- Based on human experience, the possession of firearms (or related items) is often associated with organised drug supply, particularly in commercial quantities.  
- The bullets do not need to prove the existence of a gun; they contribute circumstantially to a broader inference.

**Answer Summary**  
✓ Evidence admissible. It satisfies s 55 by providing a minimal logical connection to the fact in issue (intent to traffic). Arguments about prejudice go to s 137, not relevance.

---

### Problem: The Unhappy Marriage (*Neal v The Queen*)

**Facts**  
A man was accused of child sexual abuse. The prosecution led evidence that he was in a sexless marriage, implying motive for seeking gratification elsewhere.

**Issue(s)**  
- Is there a logical connection between an unsatisfactory marriage and abuse of a child?  
- Does human experience support such an inference?

**Lecturer’s Reasoning**  
- While some courts accept distress or marital dissatisfaction as capable of supporting inferences of sexual misconduct, such connections are tenuous and fraught with risk.  
- There were multiple alternative explanations.  
- In *Neal*, the court admitted the evidence, but directed the jury to treat it cautiously.

**Answer Summary**  
✓ Admissible with strong judicial warning. Relevance marginal; prejudice risk high. The inference, while logically possible, lacks strong empirical support.

## Practical Exam and Study Tips

### IRAC Structuring

- **Always begin with s 55**: Ask whether the evidence, if accepted, could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of a fact in issue.
- **Identify the fact in issue**: Link the evidence to an ultimate, primary, or intermediate fact.
- **State the logical connection**: How would the evidence assist a reasonable fact finder?
- **Distinguish weight from admissibility**: Weak or low probative evidence may still be relevant.
- **Anticipate exclusions**: Relevance ≠ admissibility; apply ss 135–137 if needed.

### Memory Aids / Mnemonics

- **“Minimum ATAR” = Relevance**
  - *A* – Accept evidence as true
  - *T* – Threshold is low
  - *A* – Assess probability, not truth
  - *R* – Relevance to a fact in issue

- **“Inference ≠ Speculation”**
  - Ground your argument in *Ryan*:
    - Step 1: Is inference possible based on human experience?
    - Step 2: Is it the most likely explanation?

- **“Proof Needs Path”**
  - Evidence must support a logical chain or cable — single weak links may fail unless corroborated.

### Warnings

- Don’t confuse “weight” with “relevance”.
- Don’t argue admissibility without first applying s 55.
- Don’t infer without basis — *Clay*, *Hawes*, and *Neal* are cautionary tales.
- Always refer to the exact fact in issue.
- If expert knowledge is required (e.g. bedwetting → trauma), then expert evidence is required.

## Open Questions or Clarifications

- When should marginal relevance be excluded under s 135 versus allowed with warnings?
- How do Victorian courts assess reliability of identification evidence under s 114 after *Smith*?
- When does the presence of cumulative weak evidence reach a tipping point of sufficiency?
- What types of behaviour require expert testimony before allowing inference?
