# Podcast Script: Hearsay and Exceptions under the Evidence Act 2008 (Vic)

---

## Introduction

**SPEAKER 1:** Welcome back to our legal education podcast. Today we’re tackling one of the thorniest issues in evidence law: hearsay.

**SPEAKER 2:** That’s right. By the end of this episode—running a good 60 to 90 minutes—you’ll know what hearsay is, why it’s usually inadmissible, and the statutory exceptions under the *Evidence Act 2008 (Vic)*.

**SPEAKER 1:** We’ll take each major provision in turn: s 59, s 60, ss 65–66, s 66A, s 69, and the discretionary and warning provisions ss 135–137, s 136, and s 165.

**SPEAKER 2:** And here’s the key: every single case we mention, we’ll break down with IRAC—Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion—followed by Obiter and Why this case matters. That way, you’ll see exactly how the law develops and applies.

## Section 59 — The Core Hearsay Rule

**Learning outcome:** Explain what hearsay is and why it is generally inadmissible [oai_citation:0‡Uniform Evidence Chapter 8 Hearsay.pdf](file-service://file-47d6snYGxkrVc7pTY4XtjJ).

**SPEAKER 1:** Section 59 tells us: evidence of a previous representation is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact it can reasonably be supposed the maker intended to assert.

**SPEAKER 2:** Put plainly: you can’t use what someone said outside court as proof that it was true.

**Checklist:** Ask:
1. Is it a previous representation?
2. Did the maker intend to assert a fact?
3. Is it being used to prove that fact?
If yes, it’s hearsay.

### Case: *Subramaniam v Public Prosecutor* [1956] 1 WLR 965

**IRAC**
- **Issue:** Whether threats made by terrorists were inadmissible hearsay.
- **Rule:** Hearsay only arises where the statement is adduced for the truth of its content. If it is tendered to show its effect on the hearer’s mind, it is original evidence and admissible.
- **Application:** Subramaniam argued that he acted under duress. He sought to rely on the threats to show his state of mind, not their truth.
- **Conclusion:** The statements were admitted, as they were original evidence of his mental state [oai_citation:1‡Textbook CH7.pdf](file-service://file-HziJdreFbT9bCzTjj2nGMr).

**Obiter:** The Privy Council clarified that such statements may be admitted even if false, because their significance lies in their impact on the listener.

**Why this case matters:** *Subramaniam* is the leading authority for the distinction between hearsay use (excluded under s 59) and original use (admissible). It maps directly to the learning outcome on distinguishing testimonial and original evidence.

### Case: *Ratten v R* [1972] AC 378

**IRAC**
- **Issue:** Whether a 000 call by a distressed woman was hearsay.
- **Rule:** A statement is not hearsay if adduced to show the declarant’s state of mind at the time.
- **Application:** The woman’s call showed she was frightened and seeking help, relevant to rebutting the accused’s claim of accidental shooting.
- **Conclusion:** The call was admitted as evidence of her state of mind.

**Obiter:** The Privy Council noted that contemporaneity—the call being made during the event—enhanced reliability.

**Why this case matters:** Illustrates the blurred line between hearsay and original evidence, and foreshadows s 66A on contemporaneous state of mind [oai_citation:2‡Textbook CH7.pdf](file-service://file-HziJdreFbT9bCzTjj2nGMr).

---

### Case: *Wright v Doe d Tatham* (1837) 112 ER 488

**IRAC**
- **Issue:** Were letters written to a testator implied assertions of sanity?
- **Rule:** Implied assertions can be hearsay if intended to convey a fact.
- **Application:** The letters assumed the testator was sane, but were offered to prove his sanity.
- **Conclusion:** Excluded as hearsay by conduct.

**Obiter:** Baron Parke warned against admitting indirect opinions disguised as conduct.

**Why this case matters:** Shows how implied assertions are treated under s 59, and how intention to assert is central [oai_citation:3‡Uniform Evidence Chapter 8 Hearsay.pdf](file-service://file-47d6snYGxkrVc7pTY4XtjJ).

---

### Case: *Manchester Brewery Co Ltd v Coombes* [1901] 2 Ch 608

**IRAC**
- **Issue:** Was the act of patrons leaving beer an implied assertion about its quality?
- **Rule:** Conduct is hearsay only if intended as an assertion.
- **Application:** Patrons may have left for reasons unrelated to the beer’s quality; no intention to assert.
- **Conclusion:** Not hearsay; evidence admitted circumstantially that the beer was off.

**Obiter:** The court stressed the difference between deliberate communication and incidental conduct.

**Why this case matters:** Demonstrates the statutory test of intention under s 59(2A), and the practical boundary between inference and assertion [oai_citation:4‡Uniform Evidence Chapter 8 Hearsay.pdf](file-service://file-47d6snYGxkrVc7pTY4XtjJ).

---

## Section 60 — Non-Hearsay Purpose Becomes Truth

**Learning outcome:** Identify exceptions to hearsay [oai_citation:5‡Week 7 Canvas.md](file-service://file-EAQ2KiopJcy3YDNtc73A3k).

**SPEAKER 2:** Section 60 says: if evidence of a previous representation is admitted for a non-hearsay purpose, the hearsay rule doesn’t apply. That means it can then also be used for its truth.

**Checklist:** Ask: Was it admitted for another purpose—say, consistency, credibility, or expert basis? If yes, it can also be used for truth.

---

### Case: *Lee v The Queen* (1998) 195 CLR 594

**IRAC**
- **Issue:** Could Calin’s prior statement to police reporting Lee’s confession be used for its truth under s 60?
- **Rule:** Section 60 does not convert second-hand hearsay into proof of truth; it only applies to what the maker intended to assert.
- **Application:** Calin intended only to assert that Lee said certain words, not that the content was true.
- **Conclusion:** Not admissible for truth.

**Obiter:** The High Court reaffirmed that confrontation and cross-examination are fundamental to fairness; s 60 cannot be used to smuggle in untested confessions.

**Why this case matters:** Clarifies the limits of s 60 and prevents bootstrapping unreliable admissions into evidence [oai_citation:6‡Uniform Evidence Chapter 8 Hearsay.pdf](file-service://file-47d6snYGxkrVc7pTY4XtjJ).

---

### Case: *Welsh v R* (1996) 90 A Crim R 364

**IRAC**
- **Issue:** Could psychiatric histories provided by Welsh be used as substantive truth?
- **Rule:** At common law, histories were admissible only as the basis for expert opinion. Under s 60, once admitted for that purpose, they are also evidence of truth.
- **Application:** Histories given to psychiatrists were used both as basis for opinion and as evidence of their truth.
- **Conclusion:** Admissible under s 60.

**Obiter:** Hunt CJ warned juries must be told such histories may still be unreliable, as they are unsworn and untested.

**Why this case matters:** Shows the expansionary effect of s 60, but also the role of judicial discretion (ss 135–137, s 136, s 165) to prevent misuse [oai_citation:7‡Uniform Evidence Chapter 8 Hearsay.pdf](file-service://file-47d6snYGxkrVc7pTY4XtjJ).

# Podcast Script: Hearsay and Exceptions under the Evidence Act 2008 (Vic) (continued)

## Sections 65–66 — First-Hand Hearsay

**Learning outcome:** Identify exceptions to hearsay where the maker is available or unavailable [oai_citation:0‡Uniform Evidence Chapter 8 Hearsay.pdf](file-service://file-47d6snYGxkrVc7pTY4XtjJ).

**SPEAKER 1:** Sections 65 and 66 deal with “first-hand hearsay.” That’s where the maker of the out-of-court statement actually had personal knowledge.

**SPEAKER 2:** And the rules change depending on whether that maker is unavailable—covered by s 65—or available—covered by s 66.

**Checklist:** Step 1: Was it first-hand? Step 2: Is the maker available? Step 3: If not available, does it meet reliability conditions under s 65? If available, is it “fresh in memory” under s 66?

---

### Case: *Eastman v The Queen* (1997) 76 FCR 9

**IRAC**
- **Issue:** Could first-hand hearsay be admitted when the declarant was unavailable?
- **Rule:** Section 65 admits hearsay if the circumstances make it highly probable the statement is reliable, or if made soon after the event in circumstances making fabrication unlikely.
- **Application:** Eastman’s alleged statements didn’t meet this test; the circumstances raised doubts about reliability.
- **Conclusion:** Excluded.

**Obiter:** The Federal Court noted that s 65 is narrower than s 60: it builds in reliability safeguards, reflecting the dangers of admitting evidence when the maker can’t be tested.

**Why this case matters:** Illustrates the strict reliability filter in s 65, reinforcing the policy of necessity plus reliability [oai_citation:1‡Uniform Evidence Chapter 8 Hearsay.pdf](file-service://file-47d6snYGxkrVc7pTY4XtjJ).

---

### Case: *Papakosmas v The Queen* (1999) 196 CLR 297

**IRAC**
- **Issue:** Were the complainant’s sexual assault complaints admissible under s 66?
- **Rule:** Section 66 allows first-hand hearsay where the maker is available and the representation was made when the matter was “fresh in the memory.”
- **Application:** The victim’s statements made soon after the assault qualified as fresh, supporting their reliability.
- **Conclusion:** Admitted under s 66.

**Obiter:** McHugh J stressed that repetition doesn’t make a statement true, but contemporaneity increases probative value.

**Why this case matters:** Shows how s 66 modernises the “recent complaint” doctrine, tying admissibility to freshness in memory [oai_citation:2‡Uniform Evidence Chapter 8 Hearsay.pdf](file-service://file-47d6snYGxkrVc7pTY4XtjJ).

---

### Case: *Suteski v R* (2002) 56 NSWLR 182

**IRAC**
- **Issue:** Could hearsay from a reluctant witness refusing to answer questions be admitted?
- **Rule:** Under s 65, hearsay is admissible if the maker is unavailable and circumstances suggest reliability. Unavailability includes refusing to testify after compulsion.
- **Application:** Witnesses who refused to answer were treated as unavailable, permitting use of their statements if reliability criteria met.
- **Conclusion:** Some statements admitted, but caution applied.

**Obiter:** Kirby J highlighted that fairness requires judges to weigh whether inability to cross-examine creates undue prejudice.

**Why this case matters:** Illustrates both the operation of “unavailability” and the safety valve of judicial discretion (s 137) [oai_citation:3‡Uniform Evidence Chapter 8 Hearsay.pdf](file-service://file-47d6snYGxkrVc7pTY4XtjJ).

---

## Section 66A — Contemporaneous State of Mind

**Learning outcome:** Explain exceptions relating to state of mind [oai_citation:4‡Uniform Evidence Chapter 8 Hearsay.pdf](file-service://file-47d6snYGxkrVc7pTY4XtjJ).

**SPEAKER 1:** Section 66A carves out an exception for statements about a person’s health, feelings, sensations, intention, or knowledge, provided they were made contemporaneously.

**Checklist:** Ask: Was the statement contemporaneous? Was it about health, state of mind, or intent?

---

### Case: *Walton v The Queen* (1989) 166 CLR 283

**IRAC**
- **Issue:** Could statements by the deceased that she intended to meet Walton be admitted?
- **Rule:** Evidence of intention is admissible as circumstantial evidence that the intention was acted upon.
- **Application:** Deceased’s statements of intent to meet Walton were admitted as evidence she in fact met him.
- **Conclusion:** Admissible.

**Obiter:** Deane J dissented, warning against proving conduct of others based solely on a person’s statements of intention.

**Why this case matters:** Provides the foundation for s 66A’s statutory rule on contemporaneous statements of state of mind [oai_citation:5‡Uniform Evidence Chapter 8 Hearsay.pdf](file-service://file-47d6snYGxkrVc7pTY4XtjJ).

---

### Case: *Bull v The Queen* (2000) 201 CLR 443

**IRAC**
- **Issue:** Could a complainant’s statements of sexual intention be used to prove she consented?
- **Rule:** Section 66A admits contemporaneous statements of intention.
- **Application:** The complainant’s remarks about her intentions prior to the encounter were admitted as relevant to consent.
- **Conclusion:** Admissible.

**Obiter:** The majority noted the evidence was somewhat stilted, but admissible; weight remained for the jury.

**Why this case matters:** Clarifies that intention statements can support factual inferences about conduct, but don’t automatically prove the conduct occurred [oai_citation:6‡Uniform Evidence Chapter 8 Hearsay.pdf](file-service://file-47d6snYGxkrVc7pTY4XtjJ).

---

## Section 69 — Business Records

**Learning outcome:** Recognise the business records exception [oai_citation:7‡Week 7 Canvas.md](file-service://file-EAQ2KiopJcy3YDNtc73A3k).

**SPEAKER 2:** Section 69 allows representations in business records, provided the information was recorded by, or supplied by, someone with or reasonably supposed to have had personal knowledge.

**Checklist:** Was it made in the course of business? Did the maker have or be supposed to have personal knowledge?

---

### Case: *Lithgow City Council v Jackson* (2011) 244 CLR 352

**IRAC**
- **Issue:** Was an ambulance record stating “? Fall from 1.5 metres onto concrete” admissible under s 69, and possibly s 78 as lay opinion?
- **Rule:** Section 69 requires the representation be made by, or supplied by, someone with personal knowledge. Section 78 permits lay opinion only if based on perception and necessary for understanding.
- **Application:** Ambulance officers couldn’t have perceived the fall; the note was speculative. It was therefore not admissible under s 69. Nor did it meet the strict test under s 78.
- **Conclusion:** Not admissible [oai_citation:8‡Lithgow City Council v Jackson - [2011] HCA 36.pdf](file-service://file-Ai4K3kP6z8FEZ42bfmCXML).

**Obiter:** The High Court stressed that “necessary” in s 78(b) doesn’t mean “helpful”—it means the only adequate way to convey perception.

**Why this case matters:** Shows the boundary of s 69, and the interplay between hearsay and opinion evidence. Highlights how hearsay exceptions don’t override reliability safeguards [oai_citation:9‡Lithgow City Council v Jackson - [2011] HCA 36.pdf](file-service://file-Ai4K3kP6z8FEZ42bfmCXML).

---

## Discretionary & Warning Provisions — ss 135–137, s 136, s 165

**Learning outcome:** Understand judicial discretions and warnings [oai_citation:10‡Uniform Evidence Chapter 8 Hearsay.pdf](file-service://file-47d6snYGxkrVc7pTY4XtjJ).

**SPEAKER 1:** Even if hearsay comes in under an exception, judges have discretion to limit or exclude it.

**SPEAKER 2:**
- s 135: Exclude if unfairly prejudicial, misleading, or wasting time.
- s 137: In criminal cases, exclude if unfair prejudice outweighs probative value.
- s 136: Limit evidence to a specified purpose.
- s 165: Give the jury a warning about potential unreliability.

---

### Case: *Ordukaya v Hicks* [2000] NSWCA 180

**IRAC**
- **Issue:** Should hearsay admitted under an exception be excluded under discretionary provisions?
- **Rule:** Ss 135–137 allow exclusion or limitation of evidence that risks unfair prejudice or confusion.
- **Application:** The Court accepted McHugh J’s approach in *Papakosmas* that inability to cross-examine isn’t automatically unfair prejudice, but it can be relevant.
- **Conclusion:** Admissibility upheld, but warnings emphasised.

**Obiter:** Emphasised that reliability concerns remain relevant to weight, even if admissible.

**Why this case matters:** Shows how discretionary provisions preserve fairness, even when an exception applies [oai_citation:11‡Uniform Evidence Chapter 8 Hearsay.pdf](file-service://file-47d6snYGxkrVc7pTY4XtjJ).

---

### Case: *Papakosmas v The Queen* (1999) 196 CLR 297 (on warnings)

**IRAC**
- **Issue:** Should juries be warned about complaint evidence admitted under s 66?
- **Rule:** Under s 165, judges may need to caution juries about the dangers of hearsay evidence.
- **Application:** In *Papakosmas*, jury warnings were considered necessary to address risks of fabrication or repetition.
- **Conclusion:** Warnings form part of the safety net.

**Obiter:** Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said admissibility under an exception doesn’t eliminate the need for caution.

**Why this case matters:** Demonstrates the importance of judicial warnings in protecting fairness when hearsay is admitted [oai_citation:12‡Uniform Evidence Chapter 8 Hearsay.pdf](file-service://file-47d6snYGxkrVc7pTY4XtjJ).

---

## Conclusion

**SPEAKER 1:** Let’s wrap up. Hearsay is excluded under s 59, but exceptions open the door—s 60, ss 65–66, s 66A, s 69.

**SPEAKER 2:** And don’t forget the safety valves: ss 135–137, s 136, and s 165.

**SPEAKER 1:** Every case we’ve covered shows the balance between reliability, necessity, and fairness.

**SPEAKER 2:** For your exams, always apply IRAC: identify the hearsay issue, cite the statutory anchor, apply the facts, and draw the conclusion. And always ask: even if admissible, should the judge limit or exclude it?

**SPEAKER 1:** That’s the essence of hearsay in practice. Thanks for listening—we’ll see you next time.
