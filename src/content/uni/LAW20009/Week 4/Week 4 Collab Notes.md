# Week 4 – Witnesses and Adducing Evidence
*Subject: LAW20009 – Evidence Law*
*Lecturer: Alana Ray*
*Date: Week 4 (specific date not provided)*
*Materials: Transcript + Slides*

---

## Overview

**Topic Summary**
This week focuses on the competence and compellability of witnesses under the *Evidence Act 2008 (Vic)*, including special protections for accused persons, family members, and vulnerable witnesses. It explores practical procedures for adducing evidence—particularly the conduct of examination-in-chief, cross-examination, re-examination, and the treatment of hostile or uncooperative witnesses. The lecture includes key authorities such as *Adam v The Queen*, *Browne v Dunn*, *Jones v Dunkel*, and *Azzopardi*, each of which is broken down below using IRAC.

## Key Concepts and Legal Doctrines

### 1. Competence and Compellability
**Starting Presumption**
All persons are presumed competent and compellable (s 12, s 13(6)). Competence concerns the ability to understand and answer questions intelligibly (s 13(1)).

**Sworn vs Unsworn Evidence**
- Sworn: Must understand obligation to tell the truth (s 13(3))
- Unsworn: Court must explain the importance of telling the truth (s 13(5))

**Procedure for Assessing Competence**
- Conducted via *voir dire* (s 13(8))
- Judge may use expert evidence
- No burden on either party
- Judicial—not adversarial—process

---

## IRAC: s 13 Competency Assessment

| **Element** | **Detail** |
|-------------|------------|
| **Issue** | How is witness competence determined under the *Evidence Act 2008 (Vic)*? |
| **Rule** | s 13(1): Person must (a) understand questions, and (b) give understandable answers. s 13(6): Presumed competent unless proven otherwise. |
| **Application** | Judge uses voir dire to test capacity. Evidence of disability or communication difficulty may trigger s 31 alternative methods. |
| **Conclusion** | Competence is a threshold issue for all evidence. |
| **Ratio** | Competency depends on functional ability, not status. Presumption stands unless rebutted [oai_citation:0‡LAW20009 Week 4 Collab Slides.pdf](file-service://file-8yCYUy2LaPbiiFBG2vrMkE). |

---

### 2. Compellability and Statutory Exceptions

- **Defendant**: Not compellable (s 17); not even competent to testify for the prosecution (s 17(2)).
- **Family members**: May object (s 18); court must weigh harm vs public interest.
- **Carve-outs**: Section 19 removes protection in domestic violence, child abuse, and sexual offence cases.

---

### IRAC: s 18 Balancing – Family Member Evidence

| **Element** | **Detail** |
|-------------|------------|
| **Issue** | Can a family member refuse to give evidence? |
| **Rule** | Court must balance harm (to person or relationship) against public interest in having the evidence (s 18(6)–(7)). |
| **Application** | Particularly relevant in domestic violence; court considers nature of offence, necessity of testimony, and confidentiality. |
| **Conclusion** | Refusal allowed only if harm outweighs evidentiary value. |
| **Ratio** | Family protections yield where evidence is exclusive and crucial [oai_citation:1‡LAW20009 Week 4 Collab Slides.pdf](file-service://file-8yCYUy2LaPbiiFBG2vrMkE). |

### 3. Examination-in-Chief and Leading Questions

- No leading questions (s 37), except:
  - Introductory matters
  - By leave of court
  - If no objection
  - Agreed matters
  - Expert hypotheticals

**Narrative Emphasis**
- Use chronological storytelling
- Avoid suggesting answers

---

### 4. Cross-Examination and the Browne v Dunn Rule

**Core Purpose**
- Test credibility
- Challenge factual assertions
- Discredit or elicit favourable facts

**Rule in *Browne v Dunn***
If a party intends to later contradict a witness, they must put that contradiction to the witness in cross-examination.

---

### IRAC: *Browne v Dunn* (1894) 6 R 67 (HL)

| **Element** | **Detail** |
|-------------|------------|
| **Issue** | Must contradictory allegations be put to a witness? |
| **Rule** | Yes. A party must give a witness the opportunity to respond to any challenge to their account. |
| **Application** | Prevents trial by ambush; ensures fairness. |
| **Conclusion** | Contradictions must be raised explicitly in cross. |
| **Ratio** | Procedural fairness requires that adverse allegations be put to the witness [oai_citation:2‡LAW20009 Week 4 Collab Slides.pdf](file-service://file-8yCYUy2LaPbiiFBG2vrMkE). |

---

### 5. Hostile Witnesses and Prior Inconsistent Statements

- **s 38**: Party may cross-examine own witness with leave if "unfavourable"
- **Hostility** (s 38(6)): Can elicit inconsistent prior statements
- **s 60**: Inconsistent statement may be admitted *for truth* if otherwise relevant

---

### IRAC: *Adam v The Queen* (2001) 207 CLR 96

| **Element** | **Detail** |
|-------------|------------|
| **Issue** | Can a party cross-examine its own witness and use prior inconsistent statements as evidence? |
| **Rule** | s 38 allows cross of one’s own witness if unfavourable; s 60 allows prior statements to be used for their truth if relevant. |
| **Application** | Witness recanted trial statement; prosecution sought to admit prior police statement. |
| **Conclusion** | Statement admitted as evidence for the truth, not just credibility. |
| **Ratio** | Prior inconsistent statements can be used substantively under s 60, if relevant [oai_citation:3‡LAW20009 Week 4 Collab Slides.pdf](file-service://file-8yCYUy2LaPbiiFBG2vrMkE). |

---

### 6. Inferences from Silence and Missing Witnesses

- **Azzopardi v The Queen**: Jury cannot be directed to draw inference from defendant’s silence
- **Jones v Dunkel**: Court may infer missing evidence would not have assisted party (civil), rarely permitted in criminal matters

---

### IRAC: *Azzopardi v The Queen* (2001) 205 CLR 50

| **Element** | **Detail** |
|-------------|------------|
| **Issue** | Can silence by an accused lead to an inference of guilt? |
| **Rule** | No. Silence may not be used as an inference unless accused seeks to rely on something peculiarly within their knowledge. |
| **Application** | Trial judge improperly invited jury to draw adverse inference from silence. |
| **Conclusion** | Breach of right to silence. |
| **Ratio** | The right to silence is inviolable; silence must not support the prosecution case [oai_citation:4‡LAW20009 Week 4 Collab Slides.pdf](file-service://file-8yCYUy2LaPbiiFBG2vrMkE). |

---

### IRAC: *Jones v Dunkel* (1959) 101 CLR 298

| **Element** | **Detail** |
|-------------|------------|
| **Issue** | Can a party’s failure to call a witness support an adverse inference? |
| **Rule** | If a party fails to call a key witness, court may infer their evidence would not assist. |
| **Application** | In civil, inference more freely drawn. In criminal, constrained by burden and right to silence. |
| **Conclusion** | Permissible in civil; discouraged in criminal unless clearly warranted. |
| **Ratio** | Adverse inferences from silence are constrained in criminal cases to preserve the presumption of innocence [oai_citation:5‡LAW20009 Week 4 Collab Slides.pdf](file-service://file-8yCYUy2LaPbiiFBG2vrMkE). |

## Practical Exam and Study Tips

**IRAC Structuring**
- Identify witness status (accused, family, vulnerable)
- Determine if competent (s 13)
- Apply compellability rules (ss 14–19)
- Analyse examination procedure
- Apply relevant authorities
- Anticipate *Browne v Dunn*, *Adam*, or *Azzopardi* issues

**Mnemonics**
- “C&C” = Competent & Compellable
- “B&D” = *Browne v Dunn* = Put It or Lose It
- “60 saves the truth” – s 60 allows truth of prior statement

**Warnings**
- Do not conflate hostility with mere surprise
- Family objections under s 18 require formal objection
- Inferences from silence are *not* available against the accused

## Open Questions or Clarifications

- What constitutes hostility under s 38(6) in Victorian practice?
- Can statements excluded under s 43 be later admitted via s 60?
- Is there High Court guidance on s 18(7) balancing factors?
