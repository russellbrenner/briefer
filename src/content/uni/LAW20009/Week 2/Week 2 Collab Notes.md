# Week 2 – Judicial Discretion to Exclude Evidence
*Subject: LAW20009 – Evidence Law*
*Lecturer: Alana Ray*
*Date: Week 2 (specific date not provided)*
*Materials: Transcript + Slides*

---

## Overview

**Topic Summary**
This lecture introduces the discretionary basis upon which courts may exclude otherwise admissible evidence under the *Evidence Act 2008 (Vic)*. The four discretionary provisions—ss 135 to 138—are embedded in a five-step admissibility framework. The lecture also clarifies the distinction between legal and factual questions (judge vs jury) and introduces procedural tools like voir dire. These principles form the foundation for later topics including hearsay, opinion, and character evidence.

## Key Concepts and Legal Doctrines

### 1. Five-Step Analytical Framework for Evidence Admissibility
**Definition / Scope**
A sequential method for assessing admissibility and ensuring no critical evidentiary issue is overlooked.

**Steps**
1. **Privilege or Immunity** – e.g., legal professional privilege
2. **Relevance** – s 55: tendency to make fact more or less probable
3. **Exclusionary Rules** – hearsay, opinion, character
4. **Discretionary Exclusion** – ss 135–138
5. **Weight/Reliability** – considered by jury post-admission

**Lecturer Notes**
- Evidence must *pass* each prior step before the next is considered
- If evidence fails at step 2 (relevance), court need not consider discretionary exclusions
- Step 5 involves judicial instructions to the jury regarding limitations or warnings on use

---

### 2. Roles of Judge and Jury
**Definition / Scope**
Distinguishes functions of judge (law) and jury (fact) in trials.

**Application**
- Judge rules on admissibility, procedural fairness, discretion
- Jury evaluates credibility, reliability, weight
- In judge-alone trials, judicial reasoning must maintain conceptual separation

**Authority**
- *Jury Directions Act 2015* (Vic) – governs permissible judicial instructions

**Lecturer Notes**
- Judge cannot direct jury *what* to conclude; may only guide *how* to reason
- Voir dire ensures prejudicial material is kept from jury unless admitted

---

### 3. Section 135 – General Discretion to Exclude
**Text of Provision**
Court *may* refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is *substantially outweighed* by a danger that the evidence might:
(a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party
(b) be misleading or confusing
(c) cause or result in undue waste of time

**Ratio (from Lecture)**
A *high threshold* applies. Damage to a case ≠ unfair prejudice. Must show irrational or improper influence on the fact-finder’s reasoning.

**Authorities**
- *R v Shamouil* [2006] NSWCCA 112
  > Courts must assess probative value “at its highest”, disregarding reliability or credibility issues
  – *Ratio*: Reliability goes to weight, not admissibility

**Examples from Lecturer**
- Gruesome photographs where cause of death undisputed
- Scientific evidence beyond jury comprehension
- Marginally relevant evidence that consumes disproportionate time

---

### 4. Section 137 – Exclusion in Criminal Proceedings
**Text of Provision**
In a criminal proceeding, the court *must* refuse to admit prosecution evidence if its probative value is *outweighed* by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.

**Distinctions from s 135**
- Mandatory (“must”)
- Lower threshold—no “substantially” requirement
- Applies only to prosecution evidence in criminal trials

**Policy Basis**
- Protects presumption of innocence
- Upholds burden of proof (beyond reasonable doubt)
- Reflects principle: better to acquit the guilty than convict the innocent

**Authority**
- *R v Dupas* (2010) 28 VR 188
  > Victorian courts now apply the *Shamouil* “at its highest” rule to probative value under s 137
  – *Ratio*: Trial judges must assume jury will accept the evidence, assess what it *proves*, not its *reliability*

**Lecturer Examples**
- Prior convictions as motive: prejudicial if they inflame juror emotions
- Poor quality ID evidence without proper basis

---

### 5. Section 136 – Limiting Directions
**Text of Provision**
Court may direct that evidence only be used for a limited purpose, if otherwise there is a danger it may be unfairly prejudicial or misleading.

**Purpose**
- Alternative to total exclusion
- Allows judge to “quarantine” prejudicial effect via direction
- Empowers jury to distinguish permitted vs impermissible uses

**Examples from Lecture**
- Prior inconsistent statements: admissible for credibility, not truth
- Computer records: admissible to show user activity, not content reliability
- Sharon’s driving ban used to suggest accused drove, but not as character inference

---

### 6. Section 138 – Illegally or Improperly Obtained Evidence
**Text of Provision**
Evidence obtained improperly or in contravention of Australian law is inadmissible *unless* the desirability of admitting it outweighs the undesirability.

**Two-Stage Process**
1. Moving party must establish illegality or impropriety
2. Court must weigh desirability of admission (per s 138(3))

**s 138(3) Factors**
- (a) Probative value
- (b) Importance of evidence
- (c) Nature of offence
- (d) Gravity of impropriety
- (e) Whether deliberate or reckless
- (f) Breach of international human rights
- (g) Whether other proceedings have been taken
- (h) Difficulty of obtaining evidence lawfully

**Lecturer Notes**
Impropriety is broader than illegality—includes ethical/professional lapses.

## IRAC Case Summaries

### Case: *R v Shamouil* [2006] NSWCCA 112
**Issue**
Can trial judges exclude evidence on the basis that it appears unreliable under s 135?

**Rule**
Probative value must be assessed “at its highest”, ignoring issues of credibility and reliability.

**Application**
NSWCCA held the trial judge erred by factoring in credibility, thereby improperly reducing probative value.

**Conclusion**
Reliability is for the jury (weight); admissibility is about *capability* of proof.

---

### Case: *R v Dupas* (2010) 28 VR 188
**Issue**
Should Victorian courts apply the *Shamouil* approach to assess probative value under s 137?

**Rule**
Yes — Victorian courts now treat evidence as being accepted and assess *what it proves*, not how convincing it appears.

**Application**
High Court rejected a “realistic” (reliability-aware) view at admissibility stage.

**Conclusion**
Courts must focus on potential, not likelihood, of evidential contribution when assessing admissibility.

## Quizzes and Worked Examples

### Problem: “Anthony’s Drive-By Shooting”
**Facts**
Anthony charged following shooting incident. Prosecution relies on:
1. Eyewitness (Patsy) hearing shots
2. Note of registration 2 days later
3. Car registered to accused’s brother-in-law
4. Sharon (wife) banned from driving
5. Anthony’s prior gang conviction

**Issues**
- Whether delayed observation affects admissibility
- Whether vehicle ownership proves presence
- Whether prior conviction is unfairly prejudicial character evidence

**Lecturer’s Reasoning**
- Patsy’s evidence: relevant; delay affects weight, not admissibility
- Registration note: low reliability → may attract s 135(c)
- Sharon’s ban: inference permissible with s 136 direction
- Prior conviction: fails s 137; motive ≠ sufficient justification due to prejudice

**Correct Answer**
Exclude gang conviction under s 137. Admit remaining evidence, subject to direction under s 136.

**Common Missteps**
- Treating unreliable evidence as irrelevant
- Assuming “proof of access” is enough to show presence
- Confusing *relevance* with *weight*

---

## Criminal Procedure: Voir Dire

### Voir Dire – s 189
**Definition**
“Trial within a trial” to test admissibility of evidence without prejudicing the jury

**Process**
- Conducted without jury
- Standard: balance of probabilities
- If excluded, jury never hears it

**Uses**
- Testing voluntariness of confession
- Determining whether improper conduct occurred under s 138
- Assessing qualifications of expert witness
- Validating documents

**Lecturer Notes**
Emphasised that excluded evidence is “quarantined” from the jury, reinforcing the need to resolve admissibility *before* jury exposure.

---

## Practical Exam and Study Tips

**IRAC Technique**
- **I**: Identify the piece of evidence and what it’s being used to prove
- **R**: State the correct discretionary provision
- **A**: Apply the balancing test step-by-step using facts and risk
- **C**: Clearly conclude on admissibility

**Mnemonics**
- “PRExDi-We” = Privilege → Relevance → Exclusionary → Discretion → Weight
- s 135 = MAY + SUBSTANTIALLY
- s 137 = MUST + no “substantially”

**Warnings**
- Do not treat reliability as a reason to exclude at the admissibility stage
- Always identify *which* danger is being relied on under s 135
- Do not conflate exclusion with bad evidence—weak ≠ inadmissible
