# Week 2 – Sale of Goods
*Subject: LAW10013 – Commercial Law*  
*Lecturer: Nick Nicolopoulos*

## Overview

This week introduced the *Sale of Goods Act 1958* (Vic) and examined contracts for the sale of goods as a statutory overlay upon general contract law. The unit emphasised the formation, classification of goods, implied terms, title and risk, performance, and remedies for breach. Students explored distinctions between conditions, warranties, and intermediate stipulations, and learned when risk and property pass to the buyer.

## Key Concepts and Legal Doctrines

### 1. Sale of Goods – Formation
**Definition**  
A sale of goods contract involves a transfer or agreement to transfer property in goods for money consideration (*Goods Act 1958* (Vic) s 6).

**Elements**  
- Goods (existing, future, specific, unascertained)
- Money consideration
- Transfer or agreement to transfer property

**Key Case**  
*Vali v Whipp* (1899) 1 QB 413 – Sale by description occurs even when goods are seen but purchased relying on description
> *"Where goods are sold by description, it is not enough that the goods are merely merchantable; they must also correspond with the description."*

### 2. Classification of Goods
**Categories**  
- **Existing goods**: Owned or possessed at contract time
- **Future goods**: To be manufactured or acquired after contract
- **Specific goods**: Identified at contract time
- **Unascertained goods**: Not specifically identified at contract

### 3. Terms of the Contract
**Types of Terms**  
- **Condition**: Fundamental term, breach allows rescission + damages
- **Warranty**: Minor term, breach allows damages only
- **Intermediate stipulation**: Between condition and warranty; seriousness of breach determines remedy

**Key Case**  
*Henry Kendall & Sons v William Lillico & Sons Ltd* [1969] 2 AC 31 – Merchantable quality defined as suitable for usual purpose
> *"Merchantable quality means that goods are in such a state that they would be saleable under that description."*

### 4. Implied Terms under Goods Act
**Implied by *Goods Act 1958* (Vic) s 18 unless excluded:**  
- **Title** - seller has right to sell
- **Description** - goods correspond with description  
- **Merchantable quality** - goods fit for ordinary purpose
- **Fitness for purpose** - goods suitable for buyer's specific purpose (if disclosed)

## Study Tips
