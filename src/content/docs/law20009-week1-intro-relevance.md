# Week 1 – Introductory Matters and Relevance  
*Subject: LAW20009 – Evidence Law*  
*Lecturer: Alana Ray*

## Overview

Week 1 introduces the foundational principles of the law of evidence. The lecture covers the meaning of "evidence" and how it differs from "proof", the structure and purpose of the *Evidence Act 2008 (Vic)*, and the centrality of <Badge text="s 55" variant="tip" /> which defines the threshold of relevance. Students are introduced to facts in issue, how to categorise them, and the logical connection test that determines admissibility.

## Key Concepts and Legal Doctrines

### 1. Evidence vs Proof  

:::note[Key Distinction]
Evidence refers to information presented to the court to assist in determining facts in issue. Proof is the final legal conclusion a court draws after considering the totality of evidence.
:::

:::caution[Key Elements]
- Evidence is raw information (testimony, documents, objects)  
- Proof is the court's acceptance of the truth or falsity of a fact  
- Evidence does not equal proof  
- Proof results from fact-finder belief in the evidence
:::
:::tip[Remember]
Think of it like flour vs bread: evidence must be processed into proof.
:::

> *"I have proved such and such a fact" means "I have led evidence of this fact: I hope the court will accept and act upon it".*  
> — Wells, cited in Anderson et al

### 2. Relevance – <Badge text="s 55" variant="tip" /> Evidence Act 2008 (Vic)  

:::caution[Section 55(1)]
Evidence is relevant if, if accepted, it could rationally affect the probability of a fact in issue.
:::

:::caution[Key Elements]
- Must affect *assessment of probability*  
- Relevance must be to a *fact in issue*  
- Threshold is *very low*  
- Must involve *logical connection*  
- May be direct or circumstantial
:::
:::note[Key Cases]
- **_Papakosmas v The Queen_** (1999) 196 CLR 297: "Reliability is not the concern of relevance" — McHugh J
- **_Festa v The Queen_** (2001) 208 CLR 593: "Not enough to say evidence is weak... admissibility depends on logical connection, not strength" — Gleeson CJ
:::

:::tip[Practice Tip]
Always start with <Badge text="s 55" variant="tip" /> before assessing admissibility. "Could rationally affect" = minimal logical link. Weak evidence ≠ irrelevant evidence.
:::

### 3. Admissibility – <Badge text="s 56" variant="tip" /> Evidence Act 2008 (Vic)  
**Rule**  
Once evidence passes the relevance test, it is prima facie admissible under <Badge text="s 56(1)" variant="tip" />, unless otherwise excluded.

:::caution[Key Elements]
- Relevant evidence is admissible unless excluded  
- Irrelevant evidence is not admissible (<Badge text="s 56(2)" variant="tip" />)  
- Relevance is *necessary but not sufficient*
:::
### 4. Facts in Issue  
:::note[Definition]
Facts in issue are the legally material facts that one party must prove and the other may dispute.
:::

**Categories**  
- **Ultimate facts**: Core legal elements of the claim/charge/defence  
- **Primary facts**: Factual observations that support or disprove ultimate facts  
- **Intermediate facts**: Inferences drawn from primary facts to establish ultimate facts

**Key Cases**  
- <Badge text="Smith v The Queen" variant="note" /> *(2001)* 206 CLR 650: "Ultimate issues will be expressed in terms of the elements of the offence…"
- <Badge text="Goldsmith v Sandilands" variant="note" /> *(2002)* 76 ALJR 1024: "Facts in issue reflect the material facts that constitute the claimant's cause of action…"

## Study Tips

:::tip[Study Tips]
- Always start with <Badge text="s 55" variant="tip" /> before assessing admissibility  
- Identify the facts in issue first  
- In criminal matters, look to the elements of the charge  
- In civil matters, pleadings define the facts in issue
:::
:::caution[Key Elements]
- "Could rationally affect" = minimal logical link  
- Weak evidence ≠ irrelevant evidence
- Think of <Badge text="s 55" variant="tip" /> as a gateway test
- Relevance is necessary but not sufficient for admissibility
