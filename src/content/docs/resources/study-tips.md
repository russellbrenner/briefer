## 📖 Reading and Case Analysis

### Case Brief Template
Use this consistent structure for every case you read:

:::tip[Essential Elements]
1. **Case Citation**: Full legal citation
2. **Facts**: Key factual elements that matter to the legal issue
3. **Issue**: The legal question the court must decide
4. **Holding**: The court's answer to the legal question
5. **Reasoning**: Why the court reached this conclusion
6. **Significance**: How this case fits into broader legal principles
:::

### Active Reading Techniques

**Before Reading:**
- Preview headings and case names
- Identify the legal area and key concepts
- Set specific learning objectives

**During Reading:**
- Take notes in margins
- Highlight key legal principles (not just facts)
- Ask yourself: "Why is this case important?"

**After Reading:**
- Summarize in your own words
- Connect to other cases and principles
- Create visual aids (flowcharts, concept maps)

## 🧠 Memory and Retention

### Spaced Repetition System
Review material at increasing intervals:
- **Day 1**: Initial learning
- **Day 3**: First review
- **Day 7**: Second review  
- **Day 21**: Third review
- **Day 60**: Long-term retention check
