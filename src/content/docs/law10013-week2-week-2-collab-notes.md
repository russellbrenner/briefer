# Week 2 – Sale of Goods
*Subject: LAW10013 – Commercial Law*
*Lecturer: Nick Nicolopoulos*
*Date: TP2 2025*
*Materials: Transcript + Slides*

## Overview

**Topic Summary**
This week introduced the *Sale of Goods Act 1958* (Vic) and examined contracts for the sale of goods as a statutory overlay upon general contract law. The unit emphasised the formation, classification of goods, implied terms, title and risk, performance, and remedies for breach. Students explored distinctions between conditions, warranties, and intermediate stipulations, and learned when risk and property pass to the buyer. Bianca’s case study was used to apply these principles to defective goods sold online.

## Key Concepts and Legal Doctrines

### 1. Sale of Goods – Formation
:::note[Definition]
A sale of goods contract involves a transfer or agreement to transfer property in goods for money consideration (*Goods Act 1958* (Vic) <Badge text="s 6" variant="tip" />).
:::

**Elements / Test**
- Goods (existing, future, specific, unascertained)
- Money consideration
- Transfer or agreement to transfer property

:::note[Key Cases & Authorities]
- <Badge text="<Badge text="Vali v Whipp" variant="caution" />" variant="note" /> *(1899)* 1 QB 413 – Sale by description occurs even when goods are seen but purchased relying on description
:::  > *"Where goods are sold by description, it is not enough that the goods are merely merchantable; they must also correspond with the description."*
>
> — ***Queen’s Bench***
  – Citation: <Badge text="<Badge text="Vali v Whipp" variant="caution" />" variant="note" /> *(1899)* 1 QB 413

:::tip[Lecturer Notes]
- Students were reminded to ‘follow the goods’ and determine where property, risk, and possession sit at each point
- Importance of differentiating an actual transfer vs an agreement to transfer
:::
---

### 2. Classification of Goods
:::note[Definition]
Goods are categorised as:
:::
- *Existing goods*: Owned or possessed at contract time
- *Future goods*: To be manufactured or acquired after contract
- *Specific goods*: Identified at contract time
- *Unascertained goods*: Not specifically identified at contract

:::tip[Lecturer Notes]
- Students were encouraged to track goods through the transaction chain and assess legal implications at each stage
:::
---

### 3. Terms of the Contract
:::note[Definition]
- *Condition*: Fundamental term, breach allows rescission + damages
:::
- *Warranty*: Minor term, breach allows damages only
- *Intermediate stipulation*: Between condition and warranty; seriousness of breach determines remedy (*NSW Act*)

:::note[Key Cases & Authorities]
- *Henry Kendall & <Badge text="Sons v William Lillico" variant="caution" /> & Sons Ltd* [1969] 2 AC 31 – Merchantable quality defined as suitable for usual purpose
:::  > *"Merchantable quality means that goods are in such a state that they would be saleable under that description."*
>
> — ***House of Lords***
  – Citation: *Henry Kendall & <Badge text="Sons v William Lillico" variant="caution" /> & Sons Ltd* [1969] 2 AC 31

:::tip[Lecturer Notes]
- Discussion on hierarchy of terms and implications for remedies
- Students must identify whether terms are express, implied, or intermediate
:::
---

### 4. Implied Terms under Goods Act
:::note[Definition]
Implied by *Goods Act 1958* (Vic) <Badge text="s 18" variant="tip" /> unless excluded:
:::
- Title
- Description
- Merchantable quality
- Fitness for purpose

:::tip[Lecturer Notes]
- Not all implied terms can be excluded (e.g. fit for purpose in consumer transactions)
- Importance of whether goods are sold “by description” to trigger <Badge text="s 18" variant="tip" /> protections
:::
---

### 5. Transfer of Property and Risk
:::note[Definition]
- Property = ownership/title
:::
- Possession = custody/control
- Transfer rules differ based on goods type:
  - Specific goods: pass when parties intend
  - Unascertained goods: pass only once ascertained

:::note[Key Cases & Authorities]
- <Badge text="Associated Alloys Pty Ltd v ACN 001 452 106 Pty Ltd" variant="note" /> *(2000)* 202 CLR 588 – Retention of title clause effective against insolvency
:::  – Citation: <Badge text="Associated Alloys Pty Ltd v ACN 001 452 106 Pty Ltd" variant="note" /> *(2000)* 202 CLR 588

:::tip[Lecturer Notes]
- “Romalpa” clauses protect sellers if buyers become insolvent
- Possession ≠ ownership; risk follows ownership unless otherwise agreed
:::
---

### 6. Performance and Acceptance
:::note[Definition]
- Delivery can be actual or constructive
:::
- Buyer’s duties: accept goods and pay
- Acceptance = conduct indicating acceptance or retention beyond reasonable time

:::tip[Lecturer Notes]
- Delivery of documents may suffice as constructive delivery
- Buyer’s silence or conduct post-delivery may indicate acceptance
:::
---

### 7. Remedies
**Seller's Remedies**
- Against goods: lien, retention, stoppage in transit, resale
- Against buyer: action for price, damages for non-acceptance

**Buyer's Remedies**
- Rescission if condition breached
- Damages for:
  - Breach of condition
  - Breach of warranty (diminution in value)
  - Non-delivery
  - Specific performance (only if goods are unique)

## IRAC Case Summaries

<div class="case-analysis-table">

| Element     | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Issue**   | Whether the goods supplied were of merchantable quality |
| **Rule**    | Implied condition of merchantable quality under sale of goods legislation |
| **Application** | The goods were unfit for their usual commercial purpose |
| **Conclusion**  | Breach of condition established |
| **Ratio**   | Merchantable quality requires goods be fit for ordinary use and resale |

### Case: <Badge text="<Badge text="Hadley v Baxendale" variant="caution" />" variant="note" /> *(1854)* 9 Exch 341

<div class="case-analysis-table">

| Element     | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Issue**   | When are damages for breach of contract too remote? |
| **Rule**    | Loss must be foreseeable and within contemplation of both parties |
| **Application** | Delay caused unforeseeable loss; damages denied |
| **Conclusion**  | Loss too remote, no damages awarded |
| **Ratio**   | Damages are recoverable only if they arise naturally or were foreseeable by both parties |

### Case: <Badge text="Associated Alloys Pty Ltd v ACN 001 452 106 Pty Ltd" variant="note" /> *(2000)* 202 CLR 588

| **Rule**    | Romalpa clause valid if clearly expressed and incorporated |
| **Application** | Clause operated to preserve seller’s proprietary rights |
| **Conclusion**  | Seller had superior title; goods not part of insolvent estate |

## Worked Examples

### Problem: Bianca’s Online Shopping Disaster
**Facts**
Bianca purchases gardening equipment described as "brand new". Goods are second-hand and defective. Retailer claims disclaimer on liability via online T&Cs.

**Issue(s)**
- Does the *Goods Act 1958* (Vic) apply?
- Were there breaches of implied terms (description, merchantable quality)?
- Can the seller validly exclude these terms?
- Are damages for Bianca's car window recoverable?

**Lecturer’s Reasoning**
- Contract of sale exists: goods, price, transfer
- Section 18 implied terms triggered: description, merchantable quality
- No evidence exclusion clause was effective (express agreement needed)
- Damages for car likely too remote under *<Badge text="Hadley v Baxendale" variant="caution" />*

**Answer Summary**
✓ Contract governed by *Goods Act 1958*
✓ Goods breached implied conditions
✓ Seller likely cannot rely on exclusion clause
✗ Car window damages likely unrecoverable as too remote [oai_citation:0‡LAW20009 Collab Transcript Week 2 - Supplementary Discussion.txt](file-service://file-Rn4RanxRt9up6haxB8KkQM)

## Practical Exam and Study Tips

:::tip[Study Tips]
- Begin with identifying whether the contract is governed by statute (e.g. *Goods Act*)
- Always check for sale by description → triggers implied terms
- Consider nature of goods (specific, future, unascertained) to determine remedies
:::
**Memory Aids / Mnemonics**
- FITD: *Fitness*, *Implied*, *Title*, *Description*
- CPR: *Condition*, *Performance*, *Remedy*

:::caution[Important Warnings]
- Beware: Acceptance can occur by conduct even if defective
- Not all exclusion clauses are valid; express agreement is key
- Damages must not be too remote

## Open Questions or Clarifications
- Can online sellers restrict statutory warranties through web-based exclusion clauses?
- How does the *Australian Consumer Law* overlay with state-based goods legislation in B2C transactions?
