# Week 5 – Hearsay and Its Exceptions
*Subject: LAW20009 – Evidence Law*
*Lecturer: Alana Ray*
*Date: Week 5 (specific date not provided)*
*Materials: Transcript + Slides*

## Overview

**Topic Summary**
Week 5 introduces the hearsay rule under section 59 of the ***Evidence Act 2008** *(Vic)**, including its application, key exceptions (section<Badge text="s 60" variant="tip" />–75), and related principles. The lecture provides a structured analytical approach to hearsay issues, case-based examples, and practical guidance for assessment problem-solving.

## Key Concepts and Legal Doctrines

### 1. The Hearsay Rule – Section 59

:::note[Definition]
Hearsay evidence involves a previous representation made by someone outside of court, offered in court to prove the truth of its contents.
:::

:::caution[Key Elements]
- Previous representation (statement or implied assertion)
- Made out-of-court
- Tendered to prove the truth of the representation
:::
**Purpose Test**
If evidence is offered for a non-hearsay purpose (e.g., effect on listener, state of mind), it may avoid the hearsay rule.

---

### IRAC: *<Badge text="Subramaniam v Public Prosecutor" variant="caution" />* [1956] 1 WLR 965

<div class="case-analysis-table">

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Issue** | Is evidence of out-of-court statements hearsay if tendered for a purpose other than proving truth? |
| **Rule** | Statements used for purposes other than proving their truth are not hearsay. |
| **Application** | Statements of threats offered not for their truth but to establish duress. |
| **Conclusion** | Admissible. |
| **Ratio** | Statements are only hearsay if offered to prove the truth of their contents. |


</div>
---

### 2. Section 60 – Exception for Evidence Admitted for Non-Hearsay Purposes

**Operation**
Allows evidence admitted initially for a non-hearsay purpose to also be used for its truth.

**Example**
- Statement admitted to explain police actions later admissible to prove the stated facts are true.

---

### IRAC: <Badge text="<Badge text="Lee v The Queen" variant="caution" />" variant="note" /> *(1998)* 195 CLR 594

<div class="case-analysis-table">

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Issue** | Can statements initially admitted for credibility be subsequently used for their truth under <Badge text="s 60" variant="tip" />? |
| **Rule** | <Badge text="s 60" variant="tip" /> permits the truth of evidence initially admitted for another purpose. |
| **Application** | Prior statements initially admitted to assess credibility were allowed to prove truth. |
| **Conclusion** | Admissible. |
| **Ratio** | Evidence admitted for non-hearsay reasons becomes substantive evidence under <Badge text="s 60" variant="tip" />. |


</div>

### 3. Other Key Exceptions (s<Badge text="s 61" variant="tip" />–75)

#### Section 65 – Unavailable Witnesses
Admits hearsay statements from unavailable witnesses if reliable.

#### Section 66 – Available Witness with Limited Memory
Allows contemporaneous statements to bolster memory or credibility.

#### Section 69 – Business Records
Documents created in regular business practice admissible as evidence of truth.

#### Section<Badge text="s 81" variant="tip" />–82 – Admissions and Representations
Statements made by a party against their interest or prior consistent statements under certain conditions.

### IRAC: <Badge text="<Badge text="Walton v The Queen" variant="caution" />" variant="note" /> *(1989)* 166 CLR 283

<div class="case-analysis-table">

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Issue** | Does hearsay rule apply to implied assertions? |
| **Rule** | Only intentional assertions fall under hearsay. |
| **Application** | Witness’s implied belief inferred from conduct not intentionally asserted. |
| **Conclusion** | Not hearsay. |
| **Ratio** | Hearsay rule applies only to intentionally asserted statements. |


</div>
---

## Practical Application Framework

**Five-Step Analytical Approach to Hearsay:**

1. Is it a previous representation (statement/assertion)?
2. Is it offered to prove its truth?
3. If yes, does <Badge text="s 60" variant="tip" /> allow admission for truth via a non-hearsay purpose?
4. Are there other exceptions (s<Badge text="s 61" variant="tip" />–75)?
5. Should it still be excluded under discretionary exclusion (s<Badge text="s 135" variant="tip" />, 137)?

## Worked Examples

### Quiz Example: Witness Statement Scenario

**Facts**
Witness testifies, "I heard Sarah say she saw Dave steal the wallet."

**Issues**
- Is Sarah’s statement hearsay?
- Is it admissible?

**IRAC Analysis**

<div class="case-analysis-table">

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Issue** | Can witness testimony about Sarah’s statement be admitted to prove Dave stole the wallet? |
| **Rule** | Hearsay under <Badge text="s 59" variant="tip" />; may be admissible under exceptions (s<Badge text="s 60" variant="tip" />, 65, 66). |
| **Application** | Statement offered to prove theft. Likely hearsay without exceptions (availability, contemporaneity not indicated). |
| **Conclusion** | Likely inadmissible without exceptions met. |
| **Ratio** | Hearsay requires explicit exception to be admissible for truth. |

## Practical Exam and Study Tips

:::tip[Study Tips]
- Clearly identify the hearsay purpose.
- Apply <Badge text="s 60" variant="tip" /> carefully—ensure original non-hearsay purpose clear.
- Analyse each relevant hearsay exception separately.
:::
**Key Mnemonics**
- "Truth-Purpose = Hearsay"
- "Non-Truth Purpose + <Badge text="s 60" variant="tip" /> = Possibly admissible"
- "Unavailable? → Check <Badge text="s 65" variant="tip" />"
- "Business document? → <Badge text="s 69" variant="tip" />"

**Common Mistakes**
- Treating statements of intention or state of mind automatically as hearsay.
- Overlooking <Badge text="s 60" variant="tip" /> dual-purpose admissibility.

## Open Questions or Clarifications

- Clarify situations where <Badge text="s 60" variant="tip" /> does not apply despite non-hearsay initial purpose.
- Thresholds for reliability under <Badge text="s 65" variant="tip" />—when does hearsay become sufficiently reliable?
