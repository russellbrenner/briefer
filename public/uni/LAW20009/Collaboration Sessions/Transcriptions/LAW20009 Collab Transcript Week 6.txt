Speaker 1: 
17:30:16.000-17:30:17.040
All right, sorry.

Speaker 1: 
17:30:17.200-17:30:18.560
Can everyone hear me now?

Speaker 1: 
17:30:21.859-17:30:24.180
Okay, excellent, excellent.

Speaker 2: 
17:30:24.340-17:30:27.939
That would have been bad if I recorded this lecture and no one could hear me.

Speaker 2: 
17:30:28.560-17:30:29.040
All right.

Speaker 2: 
17:30:29.280-17:30:31.520
So welcome to Evidence Law, everyone.

Speaker 2: 
17:30:31.760-17:30:32.880
Welcome to your first week.

Speaker 2: 
17:30:33.040-17:30:34.880
How's everyone's first week been going?

Speaker 2: 
17:30:35.200-17:30:43.080
I know it's only Tuesday, so it's really only been like a day in almost over a half, but how's everyone going?

Speaker 3: 
17:30:46.280-17:30:50.600
Other than the delayed contract exam, which I sat today, I'm okay.

Speaker 2: 
17:30:50.900-17:30:51.940
Oh, no.

Speaker 2: 
17:30:52.900-17:30:55.780
You've had an exam and then you've got a three hour lecture.

Speaker 2: 
17:30:56.100-17:31:08.180
Well, I really hope that this lecture is hopefully interesting and makes up for the exam today, which You know, it's always hard, isn't it?

Speaker 2: 
17:31:08.340-17:31:11.460
Sometimes the exams do go for a bit of a longer period of time.

Speaker 2: 
17:31:11.780-17:31:14.980
But I do hope that you're all having a really good week.

Speaker 2: 
17:31:15.140-17:31:18.420
And it sounds like that you all are, which is great.

Speaker 2: 
17:31:18.360-17:31:23.799
So I can see some familiar names, and it's really good to have you all in my unit.

Speaker 2: 
17:31:24.119-17:31:29.320
So this unit, you will have me, a couple of you.

Speaker 2: 
17:31:30.000-17:31:34.080
a couple of learning groups will have me, and then you'll also have Jake.

Speaker 2: 
17:31:34.400-17:31:36.320
So Jake's fabulous as well.

Speaker 2: 
17:31:36.400-17:31:41.140
So he will be your online learning advisor I believe it's for Group three.

Speaker 2: 
17:31:41.460-17:31:46.580
But hopefully, you're all getting familiarized with the discussion boards, the content.

Speaker 2: 
17:31:46.820-17:31:51.460
Does everyone have the textbook or the versions of the textbooks?

Speaker 2: 
17:31:57.040-17:31:58.480
Awesome, awesome.

Speaker 2: 
17:31:58.800-17:32:01.200
So have we started oh, that's okay.

Speaker 2: 
17:32:01.360-17:32:02.720
And if you haven't, that's all right.

Speaker 2: 
17:32:03.040-17:32:11.300
The library offers the textbook For free, so you can get the e-text and you can download chapters of the e-text as well.

Speaker 2: 
17:32:11.620-17:32:19.760
You can also get a hard copy version if you do order it I believe there are some discounts online for students.

Speaker 2: 
17:32:19.920-17:32:23.920
I haven't looked into it, but I believe that there are some.

Speaker 2: 
17:32:24.160-17:32:29.440
So if you did want a hard copy of the textbooks, then you certainly can.

Speaker 2: 
17:32:30.980-17:32:34.739
So in terms of having a hard copy, it really depends.

Speaker 2: 
17:32:34.980-17:32:44.099
So if you're going into the exam, it generally is good to have a hard copy or at least having printed out the relevant sections of the textbook.

Speaker 2: 
17:32:44.140-17:32:45.900
To have them handy and to have them there.

Speaker 2: 
17:32:46.220-17:32:56.980
But if you make comprehensive notes, you might not need to have the entire textbook, but That being said, I was a chronic taking my textbook in kind of person.

Speaker 2: 
17:32:57.940-17:33:03.540
But if you can get it online and you can print it out and you have a copy there, then it's essentially the same.

Speaker 2: 
17:33:03.360-17:33:07.040
It just really depends on how you prefer to study.

Speaker 2: 
17:33:07.360-17:33:22.320
So throughout the unit, you will be making comprehensive notes on the topics, and you will be making comprehensive notes on the cases and the legislation And of course, we will have a session that will be dedicated to the exam in terms of revision.

Speaker 2: 
17:33:22.480-17:33:24.800
So I'll be able to guide you through what's necessary.

Speaker 2: 
17:33:24.960-17:33:55.500
But what I think is really important is from the outset, and I I mean, I'm already getting into this and I haven't even started yet, but what I think is important from the outset is to start making, I guess, notes In terms of like the legislation, certain cases that you want to bring in, certain pieces of Text that you think will be really important, just start to compile them just from the get-go, only because evidence can be a bit content heavy.

Speaker 2: 
17:33:55.819-17:33:59.739
It's very case law heavy, and you'll see when we get into it.

Speaker 2: 
17:34:00.360-17:34:04.920
But a big welcome, and I really do hope that you enjoy the unit.

Speaker 2: 
17:34:05.160-17:34:11.620
So that being said, what we're going to do Yeah, I know.

Speaker 2: 
17:34:11.700-17:34:12.900
That's a really good point, Russell.

Speaker 2: 
17:34:13.220-17:34:13.780
Let's be honest.

Speaker 2: 
17:34:13.940-17:34:16.900
The law is a very content heavy area.

Speaker 2: 
17:34:16.940-17:34:31.680
I don't think we can really I'm trying to think is there is there one that's not not really no it's pretty content heavy across the board which is the price we pay for studying law So there are two texts, and that's a really good question.

Speaker 2: 
17:34:31.840-17:34:33.280
I have had this question come up.

Speaker 2: 
17:34:33.520-17:34:36.160
We do use different sections of the textbooks.

Speaker 2: 
17:34:36.400-17:34:38.400
I think they're both really comprehensive.

Speaker 2: 
17:34:38.720-17:34:42.960
We use them interchangeably, so I recommend having both of them.

Speaker 2: 
17:34:45.160-17:34:47.880
That's just my piece of advice, to be honest.

Speaker 2: 
17:34:48.040-17:34:56.760
I think it's really important to have both because what is available in one textbook and what we refer to might not be available in the other, and that's very important.

Speaker 2: 
17:34:57.580-17:35:06.300
So in terms of the three hour lecture structure, I will get into that in a moment.

Speaker 2: 
17:35:07.240-17:35:09.720
I will give you all a break at about 6.

Speaker 2: 
17:35:09.800-17:35:10.360
45.

Speaker 2: 
17:35:10.520-17:35:14.680
Now that does sound like eons away, but I'll give you a 15-minute break.

Speaker 2: 
17:35:14.760-17:35:21.780
So it'll give you a chance to Go get a snack, stretch your legs, go get some water.

Speaker 2: 
17:35:22.100-17:35:30.240
Now, I also understand that some students like to listen to these lectures online And I think that, that's fine as well, of course.

Speaker 2: 
17:35:30.640-17:35:32.320
It depends on how you like to learn.

Speaker 2: 
17:35:32.560-17:35:36.640
And if you some students like to go for walks and listen to the lectures.

Speaker 2: 
17:35:36.800-17:35:46.240
So in the In the actual lecture itself, I will read out a lot of the content so that way, if you are wanting to revise or you know go for a walk and listen to it, it's there.

Speaker 2: 
17:35:46.560-17:35:49.440
I also provide the recordings to you all.

Speaker 2: 
17:35:49.420-17:35:53.580
So the recordings are going to be kept in the modules.

Speaker 2: 
17:35:53.820-17:35:57.180
So you can all of you access the workshop module for the week?

Speaker 2: 
17:35:57.340-17:35:59.980
It normally just says workshop module.

Speaker 2: 
17:36:02.380-17:36:03.100
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
17:36:03.340-17:36:04.060
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
17:36:04.380-17:36:07.420
So a copy of the slides will also be available.

Speaker 2: 
17:36:07.820-17:36:10.300
I'll provide them to you just so you can use them for them.

Speaker 3: 
17:36:12.060-17:36:17.580
Like normally we have them on at the collaborate sessions and they're like sixty kind of like see them all sitting there as recordings.

Speaker 3: 
17:36:17.820-17:36:18.380
Is it?

Speaker 2: 
17:36:19.660-17:36:26.260
Yeah, so the reason I popped them in the workshop session for that week is because then all of you can access them.

Speaker 2: 
17:36:26.420-17:36:28.180
So generally, I'll pop them in there.

Speaker 2: 
17:36:28.420-17:36:31.140
Otherwise, different learning groups have different access.

Speaker 2: 
17:36:31.620-17:36:38.480
If you'd like me to pop them in the Collaborate hubs, I'm more than happy to do that as well It's just that, that way, you can access them pretty easily.

Speaker 2: 
17:36:38.560-17:36:39.600
But it's really up to you.

Speaker 2: 
17:36:40.160-17:36:41.040
What would you all prefer?

Speaker 2: 
17:36:41.120-17:36:43.360
Would you prefer them under the Collaborate Hubs?

Speaker 2: 
17:36:43.920-17:36:46.560
I've had some students just prefer them under the modules.

Speaker 2: 
17:36:46.800-17:36:47.760
What do you think?

Speaker 2: 
17:36:48.640-17:36:49.840
Happy to be guided by all.

Speaker 3: 
17:36:50.480-17:36:52.640
If you have them on the collaborate, they're all seem to be in like one list.

Speaker 3: 
17:36:52.720-17:36:54.320
Like you don't need to go anywhere else.

Speaker 3: 
17:36:54.640-17:36:55.520
Like they're just like on a list.

Speaker 2: 
17:36:55.760-17:36:57.500
Yeah, so Sure.

Speaker 2: 
17:36:57.740-17:37:02.140
So the only reason that we pop them in the workshop module sometimes is because of the access issues.

Speaker 2: 
17:37:02.300-17:37:07.800
But if you do have any access issues that's okay, but if you do have any access issues, you can just Let me know.

Speaker 2: 
17:37:07.960-17:37:20.760
So, what I'll do then is I'll pop them under the Collaborate Hubs for you all, and I'll also pass them on to Jake so he'll be able to post them under the Collaborate hub as well for his learning group.

Speaker 2: 
17:37:20.440-17:37:21.560
So that way they'll be there.

Speaker 2: 
17:37:21.720-17:37:23.560
But then I also might post them under the modules.

Speaker 2: 
17:37:23.720-17:37:36.900
I just want to make sure that you all have them, but whatever works best for all of you and to make sure that you have access and that you can just make sure that you can get them whenever you need them.

Speaker 2: 
17:37:37.220-17:37:43.620
So I'll post the PowerPoints, but they will be in PDF version, so you can make some notes from them.

Speaker 2: 
17:37:44.880-17:37:48.800
And any questions about the workshops themselves?

Speaker 2: 
17:37:54.860-17:37:55.660
Not so much.

Speaker 2: 
17:37:55.900-17:37:56.380
That's okay.

Speaker 2: 
17:37:56.540-17:37:56.940
You might.

Speaker 2: 
17:37:57.340-17:37:59.100
If you do, just let me know.

Speaker 2: 
17:37:59.420-17:38:02.700
But with the workshops, they do go for three hours.

Speaker 2: 
17:38:02.780-17:38:05.820
So we'll be together from five thirty to eight thirty p.

Speaker 2: 
17:38:05.900-17:38:06.060
m.

Speaker 2: 
17:38:06.140-17:38:07.500
on Tuesdays.

Speaker 2: 
17:38:09.060-17:38:11.780
Again, I'll give you a break at about 6:45.

Speaker 2: 
17:38:11.860-17:38:13.620
You'll get a 15-minute break.

Speaker 2: 
17:38:13.940-17:38:19.139
They're normally, it'll be depending on the week, they'll be structured a little bit differently.

Speaker 2: 
17:38:19.420-17:38:29.020
So previously, we used to have one hour workshops, but ultimately, they're not really long enough to cover what we need to cover.

Speaker 2: 
17:38:28.920-17:38:35.400
So a portion of them will be broken up into content and then some revision questions.

Speaker 2: 
17:38:35.720-17:38:40.120
But normally in the introductory weeks, we'll do a bit of a mix of both.

Speaker 2: 
17:38:39.759-17:38:43.279
So sometimes I like to talk about the discussion board questions themselves.

Speaker 2: 
17:38:43.599-17:38:53.160
I might touch on that tonight and like to later on during the teaching period And sometimes we'll just do some content.

Speaker 2: 
17:38:53.400-17:38:55.400
So that way you're across it.

Speaker 2: 
17:38:55.720-17:38:58.680
But in terms of an introduction.

Speaker 2: 
17:38:58.920-17:39:05.640
You probably all read a little bit about each other, a little bit about me, but I might just introduce myself.

Speaker 2: 
17:39:05.800-17:39:09.880
So I've been at Swinburne for I think it's about five years now.

Speaker 2: 
17:39:10.860-17:39:12.380
I'm a lawyer.

Speaker 2: 
17:39:12.620-17:39:15.260
I'm a prosecutor, so I work with the police.

Speaker 2: 
17:39:15.580-17:39:22.199
Initially, I started out in family law as well as commercial law as just a combination.

Speaker 2: 
17:39:22.519-17:39:36.580
And then I moved into the community legal sector and I worked with incarcerated clients With family violence matters, family law matters, intervention orders, personal safety, and now I work in prosecutions.

Speaker 2: 
17:39:37.100-17:39:38.220
I love being in court.

Speaker 2: 
17:39:38.380-17:39:40.700
That's essentially the crux of my job.

Speaker 2: 
17:39:40.940-17:39:48.300
So if anyone knows me, they know I'm a talker, and that's essentially what I do at work So it's really fun.

Speaker 2: 
17:39:48.380-17:39:52.940
If you have any questions about court related advocacy, always happy to answer.

Speaker 2: 
17:39:53.819-17:40:01.500
In terms of the academic side of things, I've taught at other tertiary institutions and I'm currently undertaking a PhD.

Speaker 2: 
17:40:01.440-17:40:04.880
My PhD is on an area known as sextortion.

Speaker 2: 
17:40:05.040-17:40:09.360
It's a form of image-based sexual abuse and technological facilitated sexual violence.

Speaker 2: 
17:40:09.440-17:40:12.540
So something that was You know, not so recognized in the law.

Speaker 2: 
17:40:13.100-17:40:15.500
And hopefully, I'll be done with that quite soon.

Speaker 2: 
17:40:15.740-17:40:17.339
So, you know, that'll be interesting.

Speaker 2: 
17:40:17.500-17:40:20.220
But I would love to hear a bit more about you all if you.

Speaker 2: 
17:40:20.339-17:40:21.779
would like to post some things in the chat.

Speaker 2: 
17:40:21.940-17:40:32.579
I know that you've introduced yourselves on the boards and it's been great to learn more about you, but I'd love to know what your background is, what do you do for work, feel free to pop it in the chat.

Speaker 2: 
17:40:40.380-17:40:41.100
Oh, cool.

I love learning about the diversity in my students because everyone has a different background Chiropractor.

Speaker 2: 
17:41:03.160-17:41:03.880
Oh, that's so cool.

Speaker 2: 
17:41:04.120-17:41:05.480
I love my chiropractor.

Speaker 2: 
17:41:05.800-17:41:06.680

It's pretty amazing.

Speaker 2:

And That's the thing about the law.

Speaker 2: 
17:41:37.980-17:41:41.740
We all come from different backgrounds and we all bring a different perspective.

Speaker 2: 
17:41:41.980-17:41:44.620
And I think that's what's really interesting in the evidence law.

Speaker 2: 
17:41:44.700-17:41:54.240
And the things that you have learned throughout your careers and throughout your academic experience to date, you'll be able to bring a lot as well.

Speaker 2: 
17:41:54.560-17:41:57.360
So it's really great to learn more about you.

Speaker 2: 
17:41:58.240-17:42:03.440
So let's move into just quickly, I'm going to touch on a couple of different housekeeping things.

Speaker 2: 
17:42:03.680-17:42:31.000
Now in terms of extensions, so you're all I'm sure you're all pretty familiar with the extension policy, but you do have access to forty eight hour extensions, and you also have access to longer extensions as well as special consideration Now with the extensions, your OLA or your online learning advisor, which will be me and Jake, will receive your extension requests.

Speaker 2: 
17:42:31.080-17:42:35.400
So Jake will receive the extension requests that are up to forty eight hours and so will I.

Speaker 2: 
17:42:35.560-17:42:40.600
But where there are long extensions or longer extensions, they will come through me.

Speaker 2: 
17:42:41.560-17:42:46.760
Now obviously, if it's a longer extension, I will need some supporting documentation.

Speaker 2: 
17:42:47.000-17:42:53.160
So whether that's in the form of a medical Document, say it's for work-related purposes, a letter from work.

Speaker 2: 
17:42:53.480-17:42:55.640
I understand that things happen in life.

Speaker 2: 
17:42:55.960-17:43:01.800
Not everything you know is linear, so I'm always happy to work with you, and I understand that.

Speaker 2: 
17:43:01.820-17:43:05.340
So just please reach out for support if you need that.

Speaker 2: 
17:43:05.660-17:43:12.060
And if you just need some guidance or if you're struggling or need some additional time, just let me know.

Speaker 2: 
17:43:12.220-17:43:19.360
I think that the primary message here is just to communicate because I'm here to help.

Speaker 2: 
17:43:20.000-17:43:28.400
Now when it comes to special consideration, different realm, that normally pertains to exams.

Speaker 2: 
17:43:28.720-17:43:34.320
So if you are needing some special consideration, there's a whole different formula for that.

Speaker 2: 
17:43:34.640-17:43:35.920
There is a department for that.

Speaker 2: 
17:43:36.080-17:43:47.620
But as long as you let me know as well that that's what you're applying for, I can also help guide you But again, we just need supporting documentation and whatnot in order to facilitate that request.

Speaker 2: 
17:43:47.940-17:44:00.540
But ultimately, you do have access to extensions, and just keep in mind that the more information you provide, it's just going to be a bit of a smoother transition.

Speaker 2: 
17:44:00.860-17:44:06.600
So just let me know if you do need some additional support The QEA revision session.

Speaker 2: 
17:44:06.759-17:44:08.440
Now that's no longer relevant.

Speaker 2: 
17:44:08.680-17:44:10.600
So let's just cross that out.

Speaker 2: 
17:44:10.839-17:44:12.040
We don't really need that anymore.

Speaker 2: 
17:44:12.360-17:44:14.600
Now let's talk about the assignments really quickly.

Speaker 2: 
17:44:14.839-17:44:25.860
So I'm only going to touch on them briefly, and it's only because in the weeks leading up to the assignment, which we do still have monthish to a couple of months until your first assignment's due.

Speaker 2: 
17:44:26.180-17:44:39.580
I'll probably touch on that maybe next week or the week after to give you a little bit more guidance around what is required for your research assignment or written submissions as well as your oral submissions.

Speaker 2: 
17:44:39.899-17:44:43.040
So Very, very cool assignment though.

Speaker 2: 
17:44:43.200-17:44:54.240
I think it's very like likened to what it would be like in legal practice in terms of writing written submissions and thereafter having to present these oral submissions.

Speaker 2: 
17:44:54.320-17:44:55.920
So it's very good.

Speaker 2: 
17:44:56.160-17:44:58.080
I think you'll really enjoy them.

Speaker 2: 
17:44:58.400-17:45:02.400
And from the outset, it's like a fun assessment.

Speaker 2: 
17:45:02.940-17:45:05.980
So just make sure that you're diarizing these dates.

Speaker 2: 
17:45:06.300-17:45:08.380
They can creep up pretty quickly.

Speaker 2: 
17:45:08.700-17:45:15.520
Your first assessment is one thousand words doesn't sound like that many words, but I think that can sometimes be even more challenging.

Speaker 2: 
17:45:15.760-17:45:21.699
So just make sure that you are getting a head start on these assessments That's weighted 30%.

Speaker 2: 
17:45:22.019-17:45:24.019
Your oral submission is 20%.

Speaker 2: 
17:45:24.180-17:45:27.540
I believe it's a 6-minute video.

Speaker 2: 
17:45:28.540-17:45:30.060
And that's an individual assessment.

Speaker 2: 
17:45:30.140-17:45:32.300
So both all of them are individual assessments.

Speaker 2: 
17:45:32.460-17:45:34.380
So that's due on the 8th of September.

Speaker 2: 
17:45:34.540-17:45:36.780
So it's shortly after the first assessment.

Speaker 2: 
17:45:36.940-17:45:42.500
But I think it's For the purposes of creating both of them at the same time, which is actually quite handy.

Speaker 2: 
17:45:42.660-17:45:51.860
So you don't go too long between writing written submissions and then having to create oral submissions too far in the future.

Speaker 2: 
17:45:52.020-17:45:52.900
So the exam.

Speaker 2: 
17:45:53.060-17:46:00.100
I've had a couple of questions about the exams already, and that's that totally makes sense because, of course, you want to know what's going on there.

Speaker 2: 
17:46:00.260-17:46:03.540
It is a fifty percent exam, which is essentially half your grade.

Speaker 2: 
17:46:03.620-17:46:06.500
So it is it does come with its weight.

Speaker 2: 
17:46:06.820-17:46:11.940
Now the exam period is between the sixth to the seventeenth of October.

Speaker 2: 
17:46:12.020-17:46:15.860
So your exam will be on one of those dates in that period.

Speaker 2: 
17:46:16.180-17:46:20.500
I unfortunately cannot confirm what date that will be at this juncture.

Speaker 2: 
17:46:20.820-17:46:25.780
But after week seven, we shall have some more guidance around when that will be.

Speaker 2: 
17:46:26.220-17:46:28.700
I work on the exams throughout the unit.

Speaker 2: 
17:46:29.020-17:46:32.300
There's nothing that's going to be on the exam that we haven't covered.

Speaker 2: 
17:46:32.620-17:46:38.380
So yeah, it's like bred into me now, I think.

Speaker 2: 
17:46:39.620-17:46:43.220
But there's nothing that's going to be on the exams that we haven't covered.

Speaker 2: 
17:46:43.380-17:46:49.779
So rest assured, I'll make sure that we've covered everything and we'll do a really comprehensive revision session.

Speaker 2: 
17:46:50.100-17:46:53.080
And that's what these Workshops are designed to do?

Speaker 2: 
17:46:53.240-17:46:56.120
They're designed to keep building on your knowledge.

Speaker 2: 
17:46:56.920-17:47:00.040
Would oh, that's a really good question.

Speaker 2: 
17:47:00.040-17:47:09.400
So we've got a question that addresses whether Assignment 1A is going to be marked before Assignment 1B.

Speaker 2: 
17:47:09.600-17:47:10.399
So no.

Speaker 2: 
17:47:10.639-17:47:16.159
So normally what will happen is we will get that's okay, Hannah, no stress at all.

Speaker 2: 
17:47:16.240-17:47:16.880
No stress at all.

Speaker 2: 
17:47:17.039-17:47:17.600
Welcome.

Speaker 2: 
17:47:18.559-17:47:23.480
So what will normally happen is we get two weeks to mark your assessments.

Speaker 2: 
17:47:23.800-17:47:35.620
So don't feel that assignment one will be contingent on assignment sorry, assignment two will be contingent on assignment one because essentially, you're going to be making submissions Off assignment one.

Speaker 2: 
17:47:35.940-17:47:36.419
Okay?

Speaker 2: 
17:47:36.980-17:47:37.700
That's okay.

Speaker 2: 
17:47:37.860-17:47:40.820
It's not necessarily about whether or not there's a right or wrong answer.

Speaker 2: 
17:47:40.980-17:47:54.180
And you'll understand why as we go through the unit, because It's really about formulating a proper legal argument and substantiating your legal arguments, which I will give you plenty of guidance on how to do.

Speaker 2: 
17:47:54.320-17:48:11.039
So normally, we get two weeks as your markers just because it is there's quite a lot of assignments that we do need to get through, and then it also needs to go through moderation processes as well The moderation processes, of course, make sure that there's fairness across the board when we are marking.

Speaker 2: 
17:48:11.280-17:48:13.200
So it will take some time.

Speaker 2: 
17:48:15.360-17:48:22.480
Essentially, I guess the main message is assignment two sorry, the assignment one comments aren't contingent on assignment two.

Speaker 2: 
17:48:22.640-17:48:24.840
So Try to write them together.

Speaker 2: 
17:48:25.080-17:48:26.520
Hopefully, that helps.

Speaker 2: 
17:48:26.840-17:48:31.400
I know it can be a little bit daunting because it's like, oh, I want to know what happened in Assignment One.

Speaker 2: 
17:48:31.640-17:48:47.160
But ultimately, if you formulate a really good assignment sorry, really good submissions in your assignment one, you're going to want to substantiate that in your oral submissions anyway, because what we do is we put our best foot forward in any sort of advocacy Setting.

Speaker 2: 
17:48:47.480-17:48:57.480
Alrighty, so when it comes to the exam, I will hopefully try to provide you with some example or past exams.

Speaker 2: 
17:48:57.640-17:48:58.920
I just need to get some.

Speaker 2: 
17:48:59.419-17:49:01.660
guidance around what I can provide to you.

Speaker 2: 
17:49:01.980-17:49:08.539
Ultimately, I just want to give you as much guidance as possible so you don't feel unprepared, which you won't.

Speaker 2: 
17:49:09.340-17:49:10.299
You won't.

Speaker 2: 
17:49:10.519-17:49:21.360
particularly because each week we're building knowledge and we're going to be looking at different discussion board questions that address different parts of the evidence law So just keep that in mind.

Speaker 2: 
17:49:21.520-17:49:26.720
In terms of structure, when we do our revision session as well, I'll let you know the structure of the exam.

Speaker 2: 
17:49:26.800-17:49:29.200
So I'll let you know what the marks breakdown is.

Speaker 2: 
17:49:29.360-17:49:31.520
I'll let you know how many questions there are.

Speaker 2: 
17:49:32.040-17:49:33.720
Generally, they're three hour exams.

Speaker 2: 
17:49:33.800-17:49:35.400
Has anyone sat a three hour exam?

Speaker 2: 
17:49:35.560-17:49:39.480
Or generally, the law exams or Priestley exams are three hours?

Speaker 2: 
17:49:41.120-17:49:41.440
Yes.

Speaker 2: 
17:49:41.760-17:49:42.080
Yep.

Speaker 2: 
17:49:42.240-17:49:51.320
So it'll be like class tonight, except it'll probably go a lot quicker, which is good because it's kind of like one of those things that once you get in there and you're just like, okay, let's just Just get it done.

Speaker 2: 
17:49:51.559-17:49:58.840
One tip I will say is, and you've probably heard me say this tip before if you've been in one of my classes before.

Speaker 2: 
17:49:59.580-17:50:13.860
is that the discussion board questions are amazing for exam preparation because each of them focus on a different kind of evidence law And what you can do with open book exams is take in prewritten answers to different kinds of evidence.

Speaker 2: 
17:50:14.179-17:50:22.820
So for example, if one of the questions is on identification evidence and you have a prewritten answer, you already have the case law and the legislation there and you can take That in.

Speaker 2: 
17:50:23.140-17:50:32.340
So I highly recommend making some comprehensive notes and comprehensive answers to the discussion board questions as you go.

Speaker 2: 
17:50:32.519-17:50:40.120
I know it sounds like a lot of work, but it's sort of like that short term pain, long term gain thing, particularly when it comes to the evidence law.

Speaker 2: 
17:50:40.440-17:50:42.840
Are there any questions now?

Speaker 2: 
17:50:47.780-17:50:49.060
Oh, that's good.

Speaker 2: 
17:50:50.980-17:50:55.920
Alrighty, so let's get into tonight's Session.

Speaker 2: 
17:50:56.240-17:51:00.400
Alrighty, so I will ask you all some questions throughout the session.

Speaker 2: 
17:51:00.720-17:51:06.720
I don't really like to pick on people because I used to hate that when I was studying, and I would try to like avoid eye contact.

Speaker 2: 
17:51:06.960-17:51:07.600
I was like, no.

Speaker 2: 
17:51:08.019-17:51:08.820
Don't look at me.

Speaker 2: 
17:51:09.700-17:51:19.280
But I would also try to just avoid, you know, but at the end of the day, I don't like to pick on people, but it would be really great if you do have an answer to the question to pop it in the chat.

Speaker 2: 
17:51:19.440-17:51:24.400
And if I do see, you know, I mean, sometimes I will maybe ask one of you if you do have a response.

Speaker 2: 
17:51:24.480-17:51:31.220
It's only because it is a three hour session And you're probably going to get like really sick of me talking.

Speaker 2: 
17:51:31.540-17:51:34.820
It might be like nails on a chalkboard by the end of the 12 weeks.

Speaker 2: 
17:51:34.900-17:51:37.220
So I'll try to hopefully not make it like that.

Speaker 2: 
17:51:38.380-17:51:39.180
Okay, we'll see.

Speaker 2: 
17:51:39.260-17:51:40.460
We'll do our best.

Speaker 2: 
17:51:41.020-17:51:47.340
So essentially, today's lecture is foundational to everything we're going to study in evidence law.

Speaker 2: 
17:51:47.580-17:51:49.500
Now, evidence law, I love.

Speaker 2: 
17:51:49.660-17:51:52.300
It's one of the best areas of the law.

Speaker 2: 
17:51:52.620-17:52:00.300
Again, I'm probably biased because I teach it, but I just think it's so fascinating because it really underpins everything, right?

Speaker 2: 
17:52:00.460-17:52:03.820
It really does and underpins so many facets of the law.

Speaker 2: 
17:52:03.720-17:52:08.680
So this class, we're going to be covering relevance and fact finding.

Speaker 2: 
17:52:09.000-17:52:17.880
So these principles determine what evidence gets before a court in every criminal every criminal trial and every civil case in Australia.

Speaker 2: 
17:52:18.320-17:52:21.600
So it's not just academic theory.

Speaker 2: 
17:52:21.920-17:52:24.160
These rules have real consequences.

Speaker 2: 
17:52:24.480-17:52:33.160
So a piece of evidence being deemed irrelevant might mean that the jury never actually sees it Which can completely change the trajectory of a case.

Speaker 2: 
17:52:33.480-17:52:38.040
So we're going to actually look at this in the case of Smith and the Queen, and that will be later on.

Speaker 2: 
17:52:38.280-17:52:42.780
But in this case Identification evidence was excluded purely on relevance grounds.

Speaker 2: 
17:52:42.860-17:52:46.380
And that might not make much sense right now, but it will as we go on.

Speaker 2: 
17:52:46.940-17:52:50.780
Now, like I said, we will take some breaks throughout.

Speaker 2: 
17:52:51.020-17:52:52.620
I think I mean, how do you all feel?

Speaker 2: 
17:52:52.700-17:52:55.580
Like, is fifteen minutes at six forty five okay?

Speaker 2: 
17:52:56.220-17:52:58.460
Or do you want me to break it up into a couple of breaks?

Speaker 2: 
17:52:58.700-17:52:59.020
I don't know.

Speaker 2: 
17:52:59.420-17:53:03.340
I just want to make sure everyone's comfortable because I know it's a long period of time.

Speaker 2: 
17:53:08.679-17:53:09.559
Okay, cool.

Speaker 2: 
17:53:09.799-17:53:13.640
Well, what we can do is if it works for this session.

Speaker 2: 
17:53:15.700-17:53:16.260
Awesome.

Speaker 2: 
17:53:16.580-17:53:17.060
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
17:53:17.140-17:53:17.460
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
17:53:17.620-17:53:19.700
So less breaks equal better, correct.

Speaker 2: 
17:53:20.100-17:53:21.460
Because means will be done quicker.

Speaker 2: 
17:53:22.420-17:53:24.640
All right, perfect Okay, awesome.

Speaker 2: 
17:53:24.799-17:53:26.720
So we'll do a bit of a half-time intermission.

Speaker 2: 
17:53:26.880-17:53:29.360
And if it doesn't work, we can always change it.

Speaker 2: 
17:53:29.440-17:53:39.580
But we'll just see how we go for now So ultimately, we just want to be able to look at Section fifty five of the Evidence Act.

Speaker 2: 
17:53:39.900-17:53:44.300
We want to categorize and identify facts in issue.

Speaker 2: 
17:53:44.140-17:53:51.420
We want to also look at logical connections, so that causal nexus between evidence as well as the facts that we need to determine.

Speaker 2: 
17:53:51.740-17:54:00.920
And we need to understand as well we need to understand the types of evidence and whether inference can be drawn from that evidence as well.

Speaker 2: 
17:54:01.560-17:54:05.400
So if I'm going too fast, just let me know, okay?

Speaker 2: 
17:54:05.560-17:54:10.200
If I'm talking too quickly, I'd rather you tell me because that way I can slow down.

Speaker 2: 
17:54:10.840-17:54:24.500
But ultimately, what we want to do is just get a really good understanding of what the evidence law is Now, I don't know if some of you have heard about evidence being kind of a complex unit.

Speaker 2: 
17:54:24.740-17:54:27.620
Now, the reason why it's complex is because of the rules.

Speaker 2: 
17:54:27.940-17:54:37.440
But once you get your head around the rules, it becomes quite clear So, from the outset, it might feel a little bit overwhelming, but I promise later down the track, you'll be all over it.

Speaker 2: 
17:54:37.679-17:54:51.860
And it's something that you will Do in practice if you decide to practice law, if you decide to go into the law, if you decide to go into any other areas, there's always going to be relevance when it comes to applying the law in terms of evidence law.

Speaker 2: 
17:54:53.100-17:54:53.740
All righty.

Speaker 2: 
17:54:53.900-17:54:57.100
So I think we should start with the most fundamental question.

Speaker 2: 
17:54:57.420-17:54:59.660
So what exactly is evidence?

Speaker 2: 
17:54:59.980-17:55:12.580
Now I feel like it'd be good for you to think for a moment about how you would define evidence in everyday langu And I'm going to ask you just to think about that and pop it in the chat before I actually provide you with a legal definition.

Speaker 2: 
17:55:15.940-17:55:18.100
What do you think it means to you?

Speaker 2: 
17:55:19.300-17:55:22.340
What do you think about when you hear the word evidence?

Speaker 2: 
17:55:28.180-17:55:30.660
Information, amazing, excellent, yep.

Speaker 2: 
17:55:30.900-17:55:32.660
Proof, proof of something.

Speaker 2: 
17:55:33.960-17:55:34.520
Awesome.

Speaker 2: 
17:55:34.760-17:55:36.280
Observable factor information.

Speaker 2: 
17:55:36.360-17:55:37.960
Oh, amazing, amazing.

Speaker 2: 
17:55:38.280-17:55:40.280
Something that suggests something occurred.

Speaker 2: 
17:55:40.440-17:55:40.680
Yep.

Speaker 2: 
17:55:40.920-17:55:42.520
Information that supports the facts.

Speaker 2: 
17:55:42.680-17:55:43.720
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
17:55:44.260-17:55:46.820
Information adduced to prove a fact relied on.

Speaker 2: 
17:55:46.980-17:55:47.940
Awesome, awesome.

Speaker 2: 
17:55:48.179-17:55:53.299
So all of these comments are completely relevant and correct.

Speaker 2: 
17:55:53.019-17:56:08.360
So the precise legal definition from our textbook is that evidence is information provided to the court to enable it to make findings as to whether the existence or non existence of the facts in issue at trial can be used.

Speaker 2: 
17:56:08.679-17:56:13.480
So this information is only useful where it would assist the fact finder in this task.

Speaker 2: 
17:56:13.720-17:56:17.080
So it's really about relevant information.

Speaker 2: 
17:56:17.440-17:56:21.200
So there are three key elements in this particular definition.

Speaker 2: 
17:56:21.520-17:56:27.360
First, evidence is ultimately information, and it's going to take many forms, as you've all noted.

Speaker 2: 
17:56:27.240-17:56:33.720
Second, it must be provided to the court, so it's not evidence until it's formally presented.

Speaker 2: 
17:56:34.360-17:56:41.260
Thirdly, it must assist the fact finder So information doesn't help determine the case.

Speaker 2: 
17:56:41.580-17:56:45.180
Information that doesn't help determine the case isn't really evidence.

Speaker 2: 
17:56:45.340-17:56:46.620
So it needs to be relevant.

Speaker 2: 
17:56:46.860-17:56:48.220
Does that make sense?

Speaker 2: 
17:56:52.960-17:56:53.679
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
17:56:54.000-17:57:03.580
So sometimes there can be some confusion, right, where around whether there's evidence meaning that it's proof, right?

Speaker 2: 
17:57:03.659-17:57:06.139
So evidence doesn't automatically equal proof.

Speaker 2: 
17:57:06.299-17:57:13.480
Evidence is not the same thing as proo And confusing these concepts can lead to serious analytical errors.

Speaker 2: 
17:57:13.799-17:57:14.120
Okay?

Speaker 2: 
17:57:14.440-17:57:25.120
So think of evidence, and like I like to think about evidence as like ingredients in a recipe So an example I use is and also makes everyone hungry, so it's the beginning.

Speaker 2: 
17:57:25.200-17:57:26.639
I'm sorry, I know it's almost dinner time.

Speaker 2: 
17:57:26.960-17:57:36.700
But evidence okay, so having flour, right, doesn't give you bre You need the right ingredients, you need the right proportions, and they need to be processed correctly.

Speaker 2: 
17:57:37.020-17:57:43.580
So evidence provides raw materials, but the proof is in the final product that the court will actually accept.

Speaker 2: 
17:57:43.360-17:57:48.159
So, I hope when you think about that, you think about bread because bread is delicious, and like, why not?

Speaker 2: 
17:57:48.480-17:57:59.440
But ultimately, the distinction matters practically because lawyers often say we've proved X But what they really mean is we've offered evidence of X and we hope that the court accepts it.

Speaker 2: 
17:57:59.760-17:58:08.780
So in understanding this difference, it will help you think more precisely about what you've actually accomplished with each piece of evidence that you present.

Speaker 2: 
17:58:09.100-17:58:11.660
And so think about this when you're writing your written submissions.

Speaker 2: 
17:58:11.740-17:58:13.660
Is this making sense so far?

Speaker 2: 
17:58:15.320-17:58:16.519
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
17:58:18.039-17:58:18.679
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
17:58:18.919-17:58:20.200
Oh, I love seeing the yeses.

Speaker 2: 
17:58:20.279-17:58:20.840
Okay, awesome.

Speaker 2: 
17:58:20.919-17:58:22.600
And if it doesn't, that's totally okay.

Speaker 2: 
17:58:22.919-17:58:24.840
Pop it in the chat or you can email me.

Speaker 2: 
17:58:25.080-17:58:26.679
Happy to elaborate.

Speaker 2: 
17:58:27.559-17:58:45.720
So in terms of, I guess, the distinction between evidence and proof, and what I might actually Detail is a quote from Saunders Legal Dictionary, and this is what our textbook actually references because I've read the textbook as well.

Speaker 2: 
17:58:46.040-17:58:48.760
So, if you do have any questions about the textbook, just let me know.

Speaker 2: 
17:58:48.840-17:58:50.520
I just like to be across it.

Speaker 2: 
17:58:50.720-17:58:54.560
So I also thought this quote was really good.

Speaker 2: 
17:58:54.720-17:58:55.680
So anyway.

Speaker 2: 
17:58:56.000-17:58:56.240
All right.

Speaker 2: 
17:58:56.400-17:59:02.240
So before a fact is accepted and acted upon, it must be proved or otherwise established.

Speaker 2: 
17:59:01.940-17:59:06.580
Evidence is the foundation of proof, with which it must not be confounded.

Speaker 2: 
17:59:06.899-17:59:14.179
Proof is that which leads to a conclusion as to truth or falsity of alleged facts which are the subject of inquiry.

Speaker 2: 
17:59:13.940-17:59:20.740
Evidence, if accepted and believed, may result in proof, but it is not necessarily proof itself.

Speaker 2: 
17:59:21.059-17:59:21.700
Okay?

Speaker 2: 
17:59:22.019-17:59:24.500
So Wells put it really beautifully.

Speaker 2: 
17:59:24.820-17:59:25.299
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
17:59:25.620-17:59:26.260
Sorry.

Speaker 2: 
17:59:26.740-17:59:29.460
It's in Anderson's textbook.

Speaker 2: 
17:59:30.420-17:59:32.340
Sorry, I should have probably specified that.

Speaker 2: 
17:59:32.660-17:59:34.820
So it's in Anderson's textbook.

Speaker 2: 
17:59:34.919-17:59:51.360
So Wells put it really beautifully, and practically speaking, the phrase I proved such and such a fact means in practically every case I have led or offered evidence of this fact And I hope that the court's going to accept it and act upon it.

Speaker 2: 
17:59:51.679-18:00:03.880
So basically, when a prosecutor stands up and says, we've proved the defendant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, what I think they really mean is we've presented evidence that we believe convinces you Of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Speaker 2: 
18:00:04.200-18:00:07.640
So I'm sure everyone's familiar with the mushroom lady case.

Speaker 2: 
18:00:07.960-18:00:09.560
Yes, do we all see that in the media?

Speaker 2: 
18:00:09.720-18:00:15.880
And I like to reference a lot of pop culture and of course a lot of relevant cases that are in the media.

Speaker 2: 
18:00:16.860-18:00:22.300
So ultimately, what had happened was the prosecution presented evidence.

Speaker 2: 
18:00:25.380-18:00:27.299
obviously counteracted that evidence.

Speaker 2: 
18:00:27.620-18:00:35.620
But ultimately, they were able to present evidence that was convincing enough that it proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Erin Patterson was guilty.

Speaker 2: 
18:00:36.140-18:00:37.900
And Russell, yes, excellent point.

Speaker 2: 
18:00:38.059-18:00:40.059
So the ABC podcasts are actually amazing.

Speaker 2: 
18:00:40.380-18:00:40.940
They're awesome.

Speaker 2: 
18:00:41.100-18:00:42.460
They really go into detail.

Speaker 2: 
18:00:43.460-18:00:54.360
What's really cool now is that they're actually, oh, cool in the sense of if you're a law nerd, but basically, they've Provided us with all the evidence that was relied on.

Speaker 2: 
18:00:54.600-18:01:04.679
And I think that that's really interesting because ultimately, you can now see how they were able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she was guilty.

Speaker 2: 
18:01:05.240-18:01:12.120
So that being said, the same evidence might result in proof in one case, but it might not in another.

Speaker 2: 
18:01:12.440-18:01:19.000
So it's going to depend on a number of different factors like witness credibility, corroborating evidence.

Speaker 2: 
18:01:19.100-18:01:25.659
whether or not cross examination was effective, as well as how the jury has interpreted and assessed the evidence.

Speaker 2: 
18:01:25.980-18:01:34.280
Now this is why evidence law focuses so heavily on admissibility rul rather than the truth determination rule, so to speak.

Speaker 2: 
18:01:34.600-18:01:44.360
But ultimately, the law's job is to ensure reliable evidence gets to the fact finder, and the fact finder's job is to determine what actually happened.

Speaker 2: 
18:01:44.760-18:01:45.399
Okay?

Speaker 2: 
18:01:45.720-18:01:47.799
So the jury, essentially.

Speaker 2: 
18:01:48.440-18:01:49.960
All right, any questions?

Speaker 2: 
18:01:53.399-18:01:56.039
And am I going too fast or is this all right?

Speaker 2: 
18:02:00.660-18:02:02.580
Beautiful.

Speaker 2: 
18:02:02.900-18:02:03.700
Okay, awesome.

Speaker 2: 
18:02:03.860-18:02:04.740
Thanks, everyone.

Speaker 2: 
18:02:06.580-18:02:07.059
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
18:02:07.299-18:02:09.860
So has everyone heard of relevance?

Speaker 2: 
18:02:10.019-18:02:16.860
And it's okay if you haven't, but this is going to literally be driven into your brain this This teaching period.

Speaker 2: 
18:02:16.940-18:02:18.620
You're going to hear relevance all the time.

Speaker 2: 
18:02:19.260-18:02:28.280
Judith posted: Johnster has written an excellent article in the H Day detailing the admissibility of evidence booked before the Morwell jury and other cases.

Speaker 2: 
18:02:28.440-18:02:29.000
Oh, amazing.

Speaker 2: 
18:02:29.160-18:02:29.640
I didn't know that.

Speaker 2: 
18:02:29.800-18:02:30.600
I'm going to have a look at that.

Speaker 2: 
18:02:30.760-18:02:31.240
Thank you.

Speaker 2: 
18:02:31.560-18:02:32.440
That's fantastic.

Speaker 2: 
18:02:32.600-18:02:48.800
And do you know what I reckon is so important that we do share these things because you'll learn so much about evidence law just through different articles, through the media and amongst One another because you'll find different things.

Speaker 2: 
18:02:48.960-18:02:50.560
So, thank you, Judith, for sharing that.

Speaker 2: 
18:02:50.800-18:02:52.400
I'm totally going to check that out later.

Speaker 2: 
18:02:52.560-18:02:53.680
So, thank you.

Speaker 2: 
18:02:54.320-18:02:56.720
So, has everyone heard of relevance?

Speaker 2: 
18:02:56.880-18:02:58.480
Or is everyone kind of familiar?

Speaker 2: 
18:02:58.640-18:03:00.080
Oh, you've even shared the other, you're amazing.

Speaker 2: 
18:03:00.160-18:03:01.200
Thank you so much.

Speaker 2: 
18:03:03.700-18:03:06.500
So Judith's just popped it in the chat.

Speaker 2: 
18:03:06.820-18:03:09.060
For after class, everyone, okay?

Speaker 2: 
18:03:09.540-18:03:18.140
So just you know, although I do appreciate it because Ultimately, these articles are just fantastic.

Speaker 2: 
18:03:18.220-18:03:19.580
I do love these breakdowns.

Speaker 2: 
18:03:19.820-18:03:21.100
So thank you.

Speaker 2: 
18:03:21.740-18:03:24.780
But you can also share these.

Speaker 2: 
18:03:25.179-18:03:26.620
I will recommend as well.

Speaker 2: 
18:03:26.560-18:03:30.080
There is a discussion board where you can talk amongst your peers too.

Speaker 2: 
18:03:30.160-18:03:36.000
So if there is anything that pops up that you want to share and you want to share it in class and you want to share it there, they're always there too.

Speaker 2: 
18:03:36.160-18:03:37.440
But I really appreciate that.

Speaker 2: 
18:03:37.600-18:03:38.960
Thank you, Judith.

Speaker 2: 
18:03:39.440-18:03:40.080
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
18:03:40.400-18:03:41.680
So relevance.

Speaker 2: 
18:03:41.840-18:03:47.760
Anyone familiar with relevance or heard of it, seen it pop up any time?

Speaker 2: 
18:03:56.039-18:03:57.000
Yeah, cool.

Speaker 2: 
18:03:57.320-18:03:59.240
So excellent.

Speaker 2: 
18:03:59.480-18:04:11.020
So you'll find that you may have you may be familiar with it and the relevance rule is really goes to the heart of evid evidence law.

Speaker 2: 
18:04:11.340-18:04:12.140
Yes, it does.

Speaker 2: 
18:04:12.300-18:04:13.179
It does, Lauren.

Speaker 2: 
18:04:13.260-18:04:16.220
It gets shouted in in any media movie that you'll see.

Speaker 2: 
18:04:16.380-18:04:21.540
They'll say objection irrelevant or When there's some sort of hearing, et cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 2: 
18:04:21.700-18:04:22.260
Yes, suits.

Speaker 2: 
18:04:22.419-18:04:28.340
They also use, oh my gosh, it's so funny because I find that in suits, I love suits as well.

Speaker 5: 
18:04:28.500-18:04:30.659
Yeah, I was about to say that, Russell.

Speaker 3: 
18:04:30.740-18:04:39.460
I think that they counted how many I can't remember how many times they actually said

Speaker 2: 
18:04:38.740-18:04:39.139
Too many.

Speaker 2: 
18:04:39.300-18:04:39.620
Too many.

Speaker 3: 
18:04:41.139-18:04:46.500
Like with the bullets instead of the bullets, it's the goddamn literally.

Speaker 2: 
18:04:46.659-18:04:52.580
Now, every time I watch Suits, I just, my mind just is just all I do is just pay attention to how many times they say.

Speaker 2: 
18:04:52.740-18:04:53.379
Say, goddamn it.

Speaker 3: 
18:04:53.620-18:04:55.460
But my son is named after Harvey.

Speaker 2: 
18:04:56.100-18:04:57.940
Oh, I mean, Harvey's a fabulous name.

Speaker 2: 
18:04:58.180-18:05:00.900
So, I mean, and also fabulous character as well.

Speaker 2: 
18:05:01.220-18:05:09.980
I mean, if anyone wants to be a lawyer like Harvey, I mean, it's pretty fabulous So relevance goes to the heart of evidence law.

Speaker 2: 
18:05:10.140-18:05:15.020
So the relevance rule is contained in section fifty five of the Evidence Act.

Speaker 2: 
18:05:14.520-18:05:17.000
Now we use the Victorian legislation, okay?

Speaker 2: 
18:05:17.160-18:05:21.000
So make sure that we are using the Evidence Act in Victoria.

Speaker 2: 
18:05:21.320-18:05:34.500
So I will read section fifty five carefully, but then we're going to break it down word for word because Really, every matter sorry, every word matters in statutory interpretation.

Speaker 2: 
18:05:35.140-18:05:54.099
So pursuant to section fifty five, subsection one of the Evidence Act The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect, directly or indirectly, the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.

Speaker 2: 
18:05:54.320-18:05:57.200
Now it's a mouthful of words, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:05:57.680-18:06:05.180
And I feel like a general consensus is that it's a little bit confusing What do we all think of that definition?

Speaker 2: 
18:06:05.339-18:06:11.099
Because let's remember, the law can be a little bit archaic sometimes and we do talk in tongues, but what do we think?

Speaker 2: 
18:06:11.420-18:06:13.980
Do you think that definition from the outset makes sense?

Speaker 2: 
18:06:14.140-18:06:17.260
Or do you think it makes more sense if we break it down?

Speaker 2: 
18:06:18.100-18:06:19.700
What do you think it means to you?

Speaker 3: 
18:06:29.260-18:06:32.620
But immediately applicable to the issues in dispute?

Speaker 2: 
18:06:33.260-18:06:33.980
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
18:06:34.220-18:06:34.700
That's right.

Speaker 2: 
18:06:34.860-18:06:35.340
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
18:06:35.420-18:06:37.520
Excell Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
18:06:37.680-18:06:48.520
So we want to look at the issues in dispute coupled with whether or not that evidence directly or indirectly affects that issue in dispute And we've got a couple of questions.

Speaker 2: 
18:06:49.080-18:06:51.000
Sorry, not a couple of questions, a couple of comments.

Speaker 2: 
18:06:51.320-18:06:53.400
It started to make sense after reading it a few times.

Speaker 2: 
18:06:53.640-18:06:54.040
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
18:06:54.360-18:06:55.960
And it's circly writing.

Speaker 2: 
18:06:56.200-18:06:56.760
I agree.

Speaker 2: 
18:06:57.000-18:06:57.720
And that's the thing.

Speaker 5: 
18:06:57.880-18:07:00.840
The law is a bit fanciful sometimes and can be a bit far fetched.

Speaker 2: 
18:07:01.000-18:07:03.280
But we work with, what we can work with.

Speaker 2: 
18:07:04.240-18:07:07.839
But that's why I like to break this particular section down.

Speaker 2: 
18:07:08.160-18:07:23.940
So if we look at the core elements, When we look at relevance, and this is going to be really important when we come to hypothetical scenarios in your exams, in your written submissions, in your oral submissions.

Speaker 2: 
18:07:23.840-18:07:26.880
Because what we always do is we start with relevance.

Speaker 2: 
18:07:27.120-18:07:30.960
Because if something is irrelevant, it's really not going to be used, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:07:31.120-18:07:36.400
So we need to make sure that we find that piece of evidence relevant from the outset.

Speaker 2: 
18:07:36.599-18:07:40.440
And as Judith made a comment as well, it's open to interpretation.

Speaker 2: 
18:07:40.599-18:07:44.359
It can be adaptable to all given situations rather than being overly prescriptive.

Speaker 2: 
18:07:44.520-18:07:45.560
And that's beautifully put.

Speaker 2: 
18:07:45.720-18:07:46.359
That's right.

Speaker 2: 
18:07:46.680-18:07:54.560
So it's not necessarily too narrow and it's not necessarily too broad, which is, I think, a very good point to make.

Speaker 2: 
18:07:54.640-18:07:55.760
So thank you.

Speaker 2: 
18:07:56.080-18:08:00.760
So if we break it down bit by bit Evidence that is relevant in a proceeding.

Speaker 2: 
18:08:00.920-18:08:02.040
Okay, what do we mean by that?

Speaker 2: 
18:08:02.359-18:08:08.760
What we mean by that is we're talking about information offered in a specific court case, not evidence generally.

Speaker 2: 
18:08:08.920-18:08:11.960
So we're talking about evidence that's specific to that case.

Speaker 2: 
18:08:12.280-18:08:20.920
Now, if we look at if that evidence or if it were accepted, we assume the evidence would be believed.

Speaker 2: 
18:08:21.080-18:08:23.480
So we're basically saying, well, it's going to believe it.

Speaker 2: 
18:08:23.720-18:08:25.320
Sorry, will the jury believe this?

Speaker 2: 
18:08:26.320-18:08:28.880
Yeah, we ask if they believe it, would it help them?

Speaker 2: 
18:08:29.040-18:08:32.320
So we want to make sure that the evidence is going to help the jury.

Speaker 2: 
18:08:32.640-18:08:38.480
Now, could rationally affect if we're looking at this, and I might just circle it as we go.

Speaker 2: 
18:08:39.339-18:08:41.260
So could rationally affect.

Speaker 2: 
18:08:41.500-18:08:43.820
Now that's a very low threshold.

Speaker 2: 
18:08:44.140-18:08:50.220
So not would definitely affect or should affect, but could it reasonably affect?

Speaker 2: 
18:08:50.320-18:08:54.720
Now we'll look you will use the word reasonably in the law a billion times.

Speaker 2: 
18:08:54.880-18:08:58.320
I'm sure you've already come across it like forty million times.

Speaker 2: 
18:08:59.540-18:09:02.500
but reasonably effect is what we're looking for.

Speaker 2: 
18:09:02.820-18:09:06.820
The Law Reform Commission deliberately set this bar low.

Speaker 2: 
18:09:06.980-18:09:08.420
Why do you think that is?

Speaker 3: 
18:09:09.619-18:09:13.700
Well to make sure half the time wasn't spent like deciding what was admissible and what wasn't.

Speaker 2: 
18:09:14.339-18:09:14.900
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
18:09:15.140-18:09:15.940
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
18:09:16.260-18:09:17.059
Absolutely.

Speaker 2: 
18:09:17.299-18:09:25.840
Because we can't substantially say that this is absolutely going to affect the assessment of the probability of a fact and issue.

Speaker 2: 
18:09:26.000-18:09:27.920
We can't determine that because it's a jury.

Speaker 2: 
18:09:28.080-18:09:28.960
How do we know?

Speaker 2: 
18:09:29.280-18:09:31.940
But what we look at is other elements.

Speaker 2: 
18:09:32.100-18:09:37.780
So if we look at directly or indirectly, what that does is it allows circumstantial evidence.

Speaker 2: 
18:09:38.100-18:09:41.620
So ultimately, evidence doesn't have to prove a fact directly.

Speaker 2: 
18:09:41.860-18:09:46.060
It can prove other facts that lead to inferences about that fact in issue.

Speaker 2: 
18:09:46.220-18:09:50.940
And we will talk about facts in issue in more detail, so it makes a bit more sense.

Speaker 2: 
18:09:51.580-18:09:57.079
Now the assessment of the probability So, not certainty, just likelihood.

Speaker 2: 
18:09:57.400-18:10:04.180
Evidence that makes something more or less probable can also be relevant The existence of a fact and issue.

Speaker 2: 
18:10:04.340-18:10:17.420
Now the existence of a fact and issue is really important because it must connect to something that actually matters in determining the case outcome And when we look at in the proceeding as well, basically context matters.

Speaker 2: 
18:10:17.660-18:10:17.819
Yes.

Speaker 2: 
18:10:17.980-18:10:19.180
So exactly right, Russell.

Speaker 2: 
18:10:19.260-18:10:20.940
It's the causal nexus, okay?

Speaker 2: 
18:10:21.099-18:10:26.299
It's that nexus between the fact and the evidence that we're adducing.

Speaker 2: 
18:10:26.420-18:10:29.300
Now when we look at in the preceding, context matters.

Speaker 2: 
18:10:29.460-18:10:48.560
So the same evidence might be relevant in one case, but it might not be in another case So the Australian Law Reform Commission actually explained the test really well, and they explained it in the sense of it only requires a minimal logical connection between the evidence and the fact in issue.

Speaker 2: 
18:10:48.480-18:11:11.260
So, it's enough if it only makes the fact and issue more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence So this low threshold ultimately serves as an important policy purpose because it's better to admit borderline evid then let the fact finder or the jury, ultimately, assess its weight than to exclude potentially useful information.

Speaker 2: 
18:11:11.420-18:11:13.980
So that's why the bar is set pretty low.

Speaker 2: 
18:11:14.940-18:11:16.540
Making sense so far?

Speaker 3: 
18:11:18.220-18:11:26.220
Is that is that like in contrast to like the bar for evidence to be admitted in like a US trial?

Speaker 3: 
18:11:26.300-18:11:35.560
I know the court I know the criminal system is entirely different But it doesn't seem like there's an objectionability to a lot of information, even if it could help the judge.

Speaker 2: 
18:11:36.440-18:11:37.400
Yes, absolutely.

Speaker 2: 
18:11:37.640-18:11:46.220
And we will certainly talk about that because For example, you know, evidence might be irrelevant where it might be unfairly prejudicial to an accused person, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:11:46.380-18:12:00.180
So, if the probative value, which we'll again talk about, so say, for example, there's something that might be too prejudicial to an accused, and it might just really throw off a jury, it might not be relevant.

Speaker 2: 
18:12:00.339-18:12:03.500
And that it really depends on the jurisdiction.

Speaker 2: 
18:12:03.820-18:12:14.220
But yes, the rules of evidence do vary, but I will say that a lot of information doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be good information If that makes sense, or not necessarily going to be helpful to a case.

Speaker 2: 
18:12:14.460-18:12:20.220
But that's why they do have hearings to determine what can be put into evidence and what can't be put into evidence.

Speaker 2: 
18:12:20.460-18:12:21.340
That's a really good question.

Speaker 3: 
18:12:21.500-18:12:23.900
And it's not an arrangement.

Speaker 3: 
18:12:23.980-18:12:25.340
What's it called in the

Speaker 2: 
18:12:25.760-18:12:26.560
An arraignment.

Speaker 3: 
18:12:26.880-18:12:29.200
Yeah, but is that what it's called in Victoria?

Speaker 2: 
18:12:30.080-18:12:35.820
Normally they'll have like a void hearing or they'll have a hearing where they'll discuss the admissibility.

Speaker 2: 
18:12:36.060-18:12:38.940
So they'll present different parts of evidence.

Speaker 2: 
18:12:39.180-18:12:49.420
So for example, if it's character evidence, maybe defence might want to introduce A certain piece of character evidence or the character about a person, but that might be disputed by prosecution.

Speaker 2: 
18:12:49.740-18:12:56.540
But they will have a hearing specifically designed to look at different evidence and to work out whether or not it can be adduced.

Speaker 3: 
18:12:56.900-18:12:58.020
Is that what happens with the trial?

Speaker 3: 
18:12:59.940-18:13:01.540
Before it progresses in the court system?

Speaker 3: 
18:13:01.700-18:13:06.340
Or is this sort of like as preparation after the trial has already been listed?

Speaker 2: 
18:13:06.420-18:13:07.460
It will be before.

Speaker 2: 
18:13:07.620-18:13:18.580
It will be beforehand, generally speaking, because it because the defence will always be privy to what the prosecution is going to rely on.

Speaker 2: 
18:13:18.520-18:13:20.440
Because that's how they're going to build their defense.

Speaker 2: 
18:13:20.760-18:13:28.700
So, in order to do that, they need to know exactly what the prosecution will be relying on Otherwise, it's sort of like you're blindsided in a way.

Speaker 2: 
18:13:29.020-18:13:36.539
So yeah, so it's a bit tricky because you hear different perspectives like, oh, is it harder to be in prosecutions or defence?

Speaker 2: 
18:13:37.520-18:13:40.079
It's really positives and negatives to both.

Speaker 2: 
18:13:40.160-18:13:47.560
I've been both, and I think that it can it really just depends on the case To be completely honest.

Speaker 2: 
18:13:48.119-18:13:58.040
But yes, it's all in the interests of fairness and making sure that there can be a fair trial to the best of the law's ability.

Speaker 2: 
18:13:58.359-18:13:59.960
That's a really great question.

Speaker 2: 
18:14:03.440-18:14:10.660
I will just say just quickly, with respect to the relevance rule.

Speaker 2: 
18:14:10.980-18:14:18.819
Now when you do write your assignments, generally you will start with that or when you do write a hypothetical problem question, you will start with relevance.

Speaker 2: 
18:14:18.840-18:14:23.160
I will, of course, provide you with a lot of guidance on how to do that.

Speaker 2: 
18:14:23.800-18:14:33.980
But just really study that and look at it in detail and familiarize yourselves with the rule of relevance under evidence law.

Speaker 2: 
18:14:34.299-18:14:36.539
So section fifty six is also very important.

Speaker 2: 
18:14:36.700-18:14:38.380
This is admissibility.

Speaker 2: 
18:14:38.700-18:14:40.460
So what's admissibility?

Speaker 2: 
18:14:42.580-18:14:47.300
What do you think I mean when I say this piece of evidence is admissible in court?

Speaker 3: 
18:14:47.940-18:14:49.460
The court's open to accept it.

Speaker 2: 
18:14:52.720-18:14:54.800
Excellent, excellent.

Speaker 2: 
18:14:55.119-18:14:55.520
All right.

Speaker 2: 
18:14:55.599-18:15:03.680
So we've got yes, so excellent, Russell, and we've also got oh, sorry, Lauren, Lauren also said there are two sides to the argument and there's also another side to disprove.

Speaker 2: 
18:15:03.359-18:15:04.079
That's exactly right.

Speaker 2: 
18:15:04.160-18:15:05.920
And that's why evidence is so important, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:15:06.000-18:15:07.760
Because there's always going to be two sides.

Speaker 2: 
18:15:08.079-18:15:15.520
And you can present a piece of evidence, but there might be a reasonable explanation for why that evidence Transpired the way that it did, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:15:15.840-18:15:17.280
So we'll get into a bit more of that.

Speaker 2: 
18:15:17.360-18:15:18.560
That's a great comment.

Speaker 2: 
18:15:18.880-18:15:24.960
Now, evidence that is admissible would generally mean that, yes, it's allowed, if it can be used.

Speaker 2: 
18:15:25.040-18:15:26.320
Accepted and whether it can be used.

Speaker 2: 
18:15:26.480-18:15:28.640
So, excellent comments there, everyone.

Speaker 2: 
18:15:28.960-18:15:41.840
So, section 56 is another important section, and this section creates what we call the general admissibility ru So it's actually quite simple, simplistic in comparison to its Section 55 counterpart.

Speaker 2: 
18:15:42.160-18:15:50.859
But pursuant to Section 56, Subsection 1, relevant evidence is admissible unless it's excluded by other rules.

Speaker 2: 
18:15:51.180-18:16:00.059
Now have a look at section fifty six subsection two, which essentially just says irrelevant evidence is not admissible, no exceptions.

Speaker 2: 
18:16:01.339-18:16:08.200
Now The law is not black and white, as we all know, and so there are going to be shades of grey.

Speaker 2: 
18:16:08.839-18:16:15.860
And what I mean by that is there will be some exceptions if you can prove that it is relevant.

Speaker 2: 
18:16:16.020-18:16:17.380
Now, sounds a bit backwards, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:16:17.460-18:16:18.580
Because it says no exceptions.

Speaker 2: 
18:16:18.660-18:16:22.440
If it's not relevant, it's it's inadmissible unless otherwise proven.

Speaker 2: 
18:16:22.680-18:16:26.600
So this is where we talk about the gateway to admissibility.

Speaker 2: 
18:16:26.920-18:16:33.099
So I would call it the gateway principle as it's noted in your textbook, but think about it like No.

Speaker 2: 
18:16:33.260-18:16:38.220
So improperly acquired evidence would be excluded, I would say.

Speaker 2: 
18:16:38.539-18:16:38.859
Yes.

Speaker 2: 
18:16:39.099-18:16:43.160
So for example, if you were to exec Actually, it's going to depend.

Speaker 2: 
18:16:43.320-18:16:46.280
See, you're going to hear that so many times throughout this unit.

Speaker 2: 
18:16:46.600-18:16:47.960
You're probably going to get so annoyed at me.

Speaker 2: 
18:16:48.200-18:16:49.000
But it can depend.

Speaker 2: 
18:16:49.160-18:17:00.160
So, for example, say police are executing a search warrant, they go into a house, they obtain some really important evidence that could be admissible in a court of law.

Speaker 2: 
18:17:00.480-18:17:14.940
Say, for example, police don't have a search warrant, they go onto a property unlawfully, they obtain some evidence and they try to put it in and try to establish that it is admissible, it'd probably be thrown out because it's improperly acquired.

Speaker 2: 
18:17:15.180-18:17:17.579
But there might be some exceptions to that.

Speaker 2: 
18:17:17.920-18:17:25.359
Say, for example, there's a high-speed chase and they pull someone over and they hear knocking in the back in the boot of the car, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:17:25.599-18:17:30.720
And they see a person in the boot of the car, they open the car and they see a knife in there, too.

Speaker 2: 
18:17:31.220-18:17:31.859
What do you think?

Speaker 2: 
18:17:31.940-18:17:36.180
Do you reckon they might be able to take that and use it as evidence even though they don't have a search warrant for the car?

Speaker 3: 
18:17:36.500-18:17:37.140
Because I can see it.

Speaker 2: 
18:17:38.900-18:17:39.619
Sorry.

Speaker 2: 
18:17:41.600-18:17:42.240
Go ahead.

Speaker 3: 
18:17:42.960-18:17:45.280
I was just going to say, because I can see it, it's out in the open.

Speaker 3: 
18:17:45.600-18:17:51.760
So like normally if they can see it, then it's they're not they're not searching anything if they can see it

Speaker 2: 
18:17:51.920-18:17:52.240
Right.

Speaker 2: 
18:17:52.400-18:17:54.400
So there might be a good argument, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:17:54.720-18:17:57.920
But what if they had to open the boot of the car and they weren't allowed to do that?

Speaker 2: 
18:17:58.080-18:17:59.040
What do you think?

Speaker 3: 
18:18:00.619-18:18:03.420
Well, I mean, defined searching inside the boot.

Speaker 3: 
18:18:03.500-18:18:23.020
Like, if you can still see it, like, have you entered like you've opened it, but have you really Like as a trigger, maybe the you know, it's a it's a it seems like if that's like if you if you can see a knife and it seems like it's been involved in a crime, can you really irrespective of whether or not You know, it's been required.

Speaker 2: 
18:18:23.339-18:18:23.500
Yeah.

Speaker 2: 
18:18:24.060-18:18:26.380
So these are the kind of arguments that you might make, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:18:26.540-18:18:28.780
If you were placed, you might be like, okay, well.

Speaker 2: 
18:18:29.140-18:18:30.740
the situation called, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:18:30.819-18:18:31.539
There was an emergency.

Speaker 2: 
18:18:31.700-18:18:32.500
Yes, exactly, Lauren.

Speaker 2: 
18:18:32.579-18:18:33.299
There's an emergency.

Speaker 2: 
18:18:33.539-18:18:35.299
We needed to we didn't have a choice.

Speaker 2: 
18:18:35.460-18:18:38.579
We didn't have time to execute a search warrant, for example.

Speaker 2: 
18:18:38.300-18:18:44.380
So there are different exceptions, and we're going to learn all about that because it's not always so straightforward.

Speaker 2: 
18:18:44.620-18:18:45.100
Okay?

Speaker 2: 
18:18:45.740-18:18:46.780
Yeah, that's exactly right.

Speaker 2: 
18:18:46.940-18:18:50.300
So voice recordings for domestic violence cases, for example.

Speaker 2: 
18:18:52.020-18:19:01.300
the evidentiary, I guess, criteria around taking recordings or illegally obtained recordings.

Speaker 2: 
18:19:01.440-18:19:02.560
Well, are they illegal?

Speaker 2: 
18:19:02.880-18:19:07.680
Was it will it be used to prove a fact in issue, like that there was domestic violence, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:19:08.240-18:19:14.299
So there are other ways that evidence can be deemed irrelevant, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:19:15.579-18:19:17.020
Even if improperly obtained.

Speaker 2: 
18:19:17.099-18:19:22.700
We actually spend a lot of time on improperly obtained evidence and search and seizure and things like that as well throughout the unit.

Speaker 2: 
18:19:22.859-18:19:27.859
But It's actually really great that you're already thinking about that because these are things that do come up in your exam.

Speaker 2: 
18:19:27.940-18:19:28.900
I'm just going to tell you that right now.

Speaker 2: 
18:19:29.059-18:19:30.900
I've seen it come up time and time again.

Speaker 2: 
18:19:31.880-18:19:35.480
Like I said, I'm going to try and give you as much guidance as I can as to what does come up.

Speaker 2: 
18:19:35.799-18:19:42.200
But one of those things that do come up is looking at how evidence is actually obtained.

Speaker 2: 
18:19:42.279-18:19:44.520
So make sure you do pay close attention to that.

Speaker 2: 
18:19:44.720-18:19:50.319
Might not come up in every exam, but I've seen it come up time and time again in my time teaching evidence law for the past few years.

Speaker 2: 
18:19:50.960-18:19:55.940
All right, so Let's have a look at the gateway to admissibility.

Speaker 2: 
18:19:56.180-18:19:57.540
So, this is what relevance is.

Speaker 2: 
18:19:57.620-18:20:00.980
Okay, so relevance is essentially the gateway to admissibility.

Speaker 2: 
18:20:01.140-18:20:03.940
So, I like to think about it like airport security.

Speaker 2: 
18:20:04.840-18:20:06.600
I hate flying, not relevant.

Speaker 2: 
18:20:06.840-18:20:08.280
That's not a relevant part of the story.

Speaker 2: 
18:20:08.520-18:20:20.560
But if you think about it, like airport security, you can't get on a plane without passing through a checkpoint But passing security doesn't guarantee your flight won't be cancelled for other reasons.

Speaker 2: 
18:20:20.800-18:20:21.119
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
18:20:21.520-18:20:22.640
So think about it like that.

Speaker 2: 
18:20:22.800-18:20:27.680
You might be able to get through, but doesn't necessarily mean it's going to transpire that way.

Speaker 2: 
18:20:27.640-18:20:44.820
So the again, the ALRC or the Law Reform Commission, I'll just call them the Law Reform Commission, deliberately uses this language to establish a presumption in favour of admitting relevant evidence So the starting point for anything in evidence is inclusion, not exclusion.

Speaker 2: 
18:20:44.980-18:20:47.380
So what we want to look at is inclusion.

Speaker 2: 
18:20:47.700-18:20:58.660
So what's important to notice, however, is something that's really important in subsection one, which says except otherwise provided by this Act.

Speaker 2: 
18:20:58.980-18:21:04.100
So ultimately, it means that relevant evidence can still be excluded under other provisions.

Speaker 2: 
18:21:04.340-18:21:06.100
So we'll get into that in more detail.

Speaker 2: 
18:21:06.260-18:21:19.060
But Section 135 provides discretionary exclusion for unfair prejudice, like we spoke about, also for confusion, so if the evidence is too confusing or if it's simply a waste of time.

Speaker 2: 
18:21:18.960-18:21:20.880
You've also got section 137.

Speaker 2: 
18:21:20.960-18:21:27.520
Now I know I'm just spouting sections of evidence law at you, but they're going to become much more clear throughout the unit.

Speaker 2: 
18:21:27.359-18:21:34.800
But section one hundred and thirty seven has a mandatory exclusion in criminal cases where the prejudicial effect outweighs the probative value.

Speaker 2: 
18:21:34.880-18:21:37.020
And I've spoken to you about this already.

Speaker 2: 
18:21:37.180-18:21:39.100
You've also got character evidence rules.

Speaker 2: 
18:21:39.340-18:21:43.020
You've also got hearsay rules and opinion evidence rules.

Speaker 2: 
18:21:43.340-18:21:54.000
So I will say Hearsay is probably one of the most complex areas of evidence law.

Speaker 2: 
18:21:54.160-18:21:58.799
So I do implore you to do a fair bit of reading on that because of the exceptions.

Speaker 2: 
18:21:59.119-18:22:05.800
Now Once you get your head around the rules, it's actually very, I guess, easy to understand.

Speaker 2: 
18:22:06.120-18:22:11.480
It always sounds really complex from the outset And everyone always talks about hearsay as being very complex.

Speaker 2: 
18:22:11.560-18:22:17.320
And look, it is, but in the sense of once you get the rules, you'll understand what I mean.

Speaker 2: 
18:22:17.940-18:22:21.380
But and Judith, sorry, Judith provided a comment.

Speaker 2: 
18:22:21.460-18:22:31.860
The preamble to Chapter three of the Evidence Act immediately prior to section fifty five has rather useful looking a useful looking flowchart on how to navigate a question on whether a particular item of evidence is admissible.

Speaker 2: 
18:22:32.240-18:22:34.400
once relevance has been established.

Speaker 2: 
18:22:34.720-18:22:36.080
So excellent.

Speaker 2: 
18:22:36.240-18:22:43.520
Like Judith said, you've got a lot of resources, and I will say that the Evidence Act is One of my favorite acts.

Speaker 2: 
18:22:43.760-18:22:46.240
Not only it's not that long, it's actually not that long.

Speaker 2: 
18:22:46.320-18:22:54.540
It's quite if you have to print it out, it's actually not that long, but it's actually one of the clearer acts So it does have a lot of guidance.

Speaker 2: 
18:22:54.700-18:22:56.780
And also Judicial College of Victoria.

Speaker 2: 
18:22:56.940-18:22:59.740
Has everyone across Judicial College of Victoria?

Speaker 2: 
18:23:04.580-18:23:11.400
If you're not, it is an amazing source of evidence Law.

Speaker 2: 
18:23:11.640-18:23:21.480
So the Judicial College of Victoria, if you literally type in Judicial College of Victoria on Google, and I also send out some guides as well about this.

Speaker 2: 
18:23:21.359-18:23:26.880
But the Judicial College of Victoria outlines the evidence law in substantive detail.

Speaker 2: 
18:23:27.520-18:23:28.960
So you've got different resources.

Speaker 2: 
18:23:29.119-18:23:32.720
So Russell's pop sorry, one second.

Speaker 2: 
18:23:33.920-18:23:37.920
I'm just going to close the so my dogs don't start barking.

Speaker 2: 
18:23:38.720-18:23:45.280
But one of the things that the Judicial College does is it breaks down the evidence law really, really well.

Speaker 2: 
18:23:45.140-18:23:53.059
So, what it'll do is it will give you cases, legislation, how the courts have interpreted different kinds of evidence.

Speaker 2: 
18:23:53.299-18:23:58.840
It's like the go-to, it's like a little guide But if you don't access it or don't have it, please do.

Speaker 2: 
18:23:58.920-18:24:03.000
And it's not only just for evidence law, it's for different kinds of law as well.

Speaker 2: 
18:24:03.640-18:24:08.280
So ultimately, relevance is necessary, but it's not sufficient for admissibility.

Speaker 2: 
18:24:08.140-18:24:10.779
So it's like university entry requirements, for example.

Speaker 2: 
18:24:10.940-18:24:14.539
So you need to meet the minimum standards, but again, doesn't guarantee you admission.

Speaker 2: 
18:24:14.700-18:24:15.980
So kind of think about it like that.

Speaker 2: 
18:24:16.140-18:24:20.840
So you might meet minimum standards, doesn't guarantee you admiss Other factors might work against you.

Speaker 2: 
18:24:21.000-18:24:27.320
I sometimes think it's like good to use real-life examples just to conceptualize evidence law.

Speaker 2: 
18:24:27.640-18:24:46.480
So ultimately, the structure reflects a balance between evidence law and truth seeking and fairness and protection So we want courts to have access to probative evidence, but ultimately, we want to protect parties from unfair prejudice to ensure that proceedings are fair and efficient as well.

Speaker 2: 
18:24:49.819-18:24:51.260
Okay, any questions so far?

Speaker 2: 
18:24:51.500-18:24:52.859
All making sense?

Speaker 2: 
18:24:54.779-18:24:57.500
And I apologize, this lecture is pretty content heavy.

Speaker 2: 
18:24:57.740-18:25:02.100
It's going to be a lot of me talking, but Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
18:25:02.420-18:25:03.060
All righty.

Speaker 2: 
18:25:03.300-18:25:04.820
So facts in issue.

Speaker 2: 
18:25:05.140-18:25:13.420
So before we can determine if evidence is relevant, we actually need to identify what facts are an issue in a case.

Speaker 2: 
18:25:13.740-18:25:19.660
So this is where some students might find it a little bit confusing.

Speaker 2: 
18:25:19.900-18:25:26.200
So we need to be really systematic about it So there are three categories of facts we need to understand.

Speaker 2: 
18:25:26.520-18:25:43.420
So we need to understand ultimate facts in issue, and these are facts that parties must prove to win their c So they need to correspond to the legal elements of causes of action, for example, in civil cases or elements of offences in criminal cases.

Speaker 2: 
18:25:43.120-18:25:45.440
Then you've got your primary facts in issue.

Speaker 2: 
18:25:45.760-18:25:50.720
So these are facts that help prove ultimate facts, but they aren't themselves legal elements.

Speaker 2: 
18:25:50.880-18:25:57.200
So they're kind of like building blocks or stepping stones towards establishing the ultimate facts in issue.

Speaker 2: 
18:25:57.359-18:25:59.359
And then you've got intermediate facts.

Speaker 2: 
18:25:59.680-18:26:08.720
So these are like conclusions or inferences that are drawn from primary facts that will help establish the ultimate fact.

Speaker 2: 
18:26:09.240-18:26:16.119
So they're a way that of I guess they're just like a station in the reasoning process, so to speak.

Speaker 2: 
18:26:16.240-18:26:20.960
So the source of the ultimate fact can differ between criminal and civil cases.

Speaker 2: 
18:26:21.280-18:26:27.840
So for example, in criminal cases, ultimate facts will come from the elements of the offence charged.

Speaker 2: 
18:26:27.520-18:26:41.599
So for example, I don't know if any of you have done you might some of you I know that some of you have done criminal law with me, but if someone is charged with robbery, for example, the ultimate facts are the elements of robbery that the prosecution needs to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.

Speaker 2: 
18:26:41.900-18:26:47.740
In civil cases, ultimate facts come from the elements of the cause of action, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:26:47.820-18:26:57.760
So if someone's brought an action So if the plaintiff sues someone for negligence, the ultimate facts are the elements of negligence that the plaintiff must prove on the balance of probabilities.

Speaker 2: 
18:26:58.079-18:27:03.980
So everyone is everyone here aware of the different Standards of proof, burdens of proof.

Speaker 2: 
18:27:04.540-18:27:05.340
Yep, excellent.

Speaker 2: 
18:27:05.420-18:27:11.640
So we've got beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases, balance of probabilities in civil cases.

Speaker 2: 
18:27:11.880-18:27:21.360
So remember, evidence law is not just about the criminal law, and I'm going to just make sure that, that is known from the outset because you will have questions with respect to The civil law as well.

Speaker 2: 
18:27:21.680-18:27:23.920
So just remember it's a combination.

Speaker 2: 
18:27:24.080-18:27:28.320
So remember to keep ahead of both of those things.

Speaker 2: 
18:27:30.080-18:27:31.040
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
18:27:31.680-18:27:32.240
All righty.

Speaker 2: 
18:27:32.480-18:27:34.160
So ultimate facts.

Speaker 2: 
18:27:34.480-18:27:39.600
Now I think what would be good is to give you an authoritative definition from Smith and the Queen.

Speaker 2: 
18:27:39.760-18:27:42.560
So Smith and the Queen, very good case.

Speaker 2: 
18:27:42.540-18:27:45.580
It comes up this week, very substantive evidence case.

Speaker 2: 
18:27:45.900-18:27:50.460
And this is where the High Court explained ultimate facts in criminal cases.

Speaker 2: 
18:27:50.780-18:28:00.740
So Pursuant to the judgment of the court, ultimate issues will be expressed in terms of the elements of the offence with which the accused stands charged.

Speaker 2: 
18:28:00.980-18:28:05.780
They will, therefore, be issues about the facts which constitutes those elements.

Speaker 2: 
18:28:06.140-18:28:14.299
So if we work through that example again, so we look at robbery, what are the ultimate facts and issues that the prosecution must prove?

Speaker 2: 
18:28:14.320-18:28:20.720
So ultimately, the prosecution needs to prove first that there was taking a property.

Speaker 2: 
18:28:20.960-18:28:24.960
Now I know we're merging into criminal law here and Has everyone done criminal law with me?

Speaker 2: 
18:28:25.040-18:28:26.160
Or has everyone done criminal law?

Speaker 2: 
18:28:26.240-18:28:28.480
And if you haven't, you will probably do it with me.

Speaker 2: 
18:28:29.119-18:28:29.839
That's fine.

Speaker 2: 
18:28:30.160-18:28:30.720
That's fine.

Speaker 2: 
18:28:30.800-18:28:34.079
You'll probably do it with me next.

Speaker 2: 
18:28:33.820-18:28:34.540
Teaching period.

Speaker 2: 
18:28:34.620-18:28:35.180
Oh, there we go.

Speaker 2: 
18:28:35.260-18:28:36.620
I've got some of my familiar students.

Speaker 2: 
18:28:36.700-18:28:37.580
I can see the names.

Speaker 2: 
18:28:37.740-18:28:38.540
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
18:28:39.180-18:28:47.340
Okay, well, so when you do do criminal law, if you haven't done it already, you'll probably think back to this first lecture and be like, oh.

Speaker 2: 
18:28:47.840-18:28:49.600
I remember when Alana said that.

Speaker 2: 
18:28:50.560-18:28:57.840
So with robbery, we're testing some of the elements now and my recollection of the elements.

Speaker 2: 
18:28:58.080-18:29:00.800
But first, it involves the taking of property.

Speaker 2: 
18:29:00.960-18:29:03.600
So we want to know Did the defendant take something?

Speaker 2: 
18:29:04.240-18:29:07.600
Second, belonging to another, did that property belong to someone else?

Speaker 2: 
18:29:07.920-18:29:11.040
Third, was there an intention to permanently deprive that person?

Speaker 2: 
18:29:11.360-18:29:13.840
So did the defendant intend to keep it?

Speaker 2: 
18:29:13.940-18:29:15.700
And fourth, the use of threat.

Speaker 2: 
18:29:16.339-18:29:18.020
Was the force used or threatened?

Speaker 2: 
18:29:18.180-18:29:19.859
Fifth, absence of consent.

Speaker 2: 
18:29:20.099-18:29:22.980
So basically, did the owner not consent to the taking?

Speaker 2: 
18:29:22.940-18:29:31.339
So each of these elements oh sorry, each of these will correspond to an element of robbery, and you'll find that in the Crimes Act in the seventies.

Speaker 2: 
18:29:31.640-18:29:33.559
Section 75, 77.

Speaker 2: 
18:29:34.119-18:29:39.000
The prosecution in that case will need to prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt.

Speaker 2: 
18:29:39.319-18:29:43.880
And if they fail on any of those elements, the defendant needs to be acquitted.

Speaker 2: 
18:29:44.020-18:29:48.260
But ultimate facts also include any defences raised by the accused.

Speaker 2: 
18:29:48.500-18:29:57.460
So if the defendant claims self defense, then whether the defendant reasonably believed force was necessary might become an ultimate fact in issue.

Speaker 2: 
18:29:57.320-18:30:03.480
So it's really important to understand the charges and pleadings as well for evidence lawyers.

Speaker 2: 
18:30:03.640-18:30:08.520
So essentially, when you're doing evidence law, it's really important to understand the charge.

Speaker 2: 
18:30:08.340-18:30:14.980
So you basically what I'm trying to say is you can't assess relevance without knowing what the case is actually about.

Speaker 2: 
18:30:15.220-18:30:18.660
I don't mean that you need to know the elements of that criminal case.

Speaker 2: 
18:30:18.340-18:30:20.980
What I mean is, you need to be familiar with what you're trying to prove.

Speaker 2: 
18:30:21.220-18:30:29.180
So, you might get a hypothetical about a murder weapon, for instance we need to know that it's about murder.

Speaker 2: 
18:30:29.500-18:30:31.819
If it's about robbery, we need to know it's about robbery.

Speaker 2: 
18:30:31.980-18:30:40.300
Because the ultimate facts are we need to be able to use that evidence to prove that that person committed murder, or we need to use that evidence to prove that a person committed robbery.

Speaker 2: 
18:30:40.540-18:30:41.500
Is this making any sense?

Speaker 2: 
18:30:41.740-18:30:43.660
Hopefully, this is making sense.

Speaker 2: 
18:30:49.320-18:30:50.600
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
18:30:51.560-18:30:53.880
All right, now we come to the civil cases.

Speaker 2: 
18:30:54.200-18:30:59.720
So in civil cases, we've got a similar analysis, but the source is a bit different.

Speaker 2: 
18:30:59.920-18:31:13.360
So in the case of Goldsmiths and Sandalands, it was noted by McHugh or Justice McHugh that whether a fact is a fact in issue depends on the pleadings and particulars of each party's case.

Speaker 2: 
18:31:13.140-18:31:26.339
The facts in issue reflect the material facts that constitute the claimant's cause of action, and those material facts that provide any justification or excuse for or a defence to that cause of action.

Speaker 2: 
18:31:26.220-18:31:33.660
So if we use negligence, for example, since it's the most common torts claim, has everyone here done torts?

Speaker 2: 
18:31:33.980-18:31:40.099
I promise this is all relevant I wouldn't put it relevant because it's section 55, but it is relevant.

Speaker 2: 
18:31:40.980-18:31:42.420
Okay, awesome.

Speaker 2: 
18:31:42.579-18:31:42.820
All right.

Speaker 2: 
18:31:42.900-18:31:46.579
Well, when you do it, you'll hear a lot about negligence and duty of care.

Speaker 2: 
18:31:46.720-18:31:52.160
But when we look at the ultimate facts for negligence, right, first we need to establish that there's a duty of care.

Speaker 2: 
18:31:52.319-18:31:54.640
So did the defendant owe the plaintiff a duty of care?

Speaker 2: 
18:31:54.880-18:31:57.599
Second, was a breach of was there a breach of duty?

Speaker 2: 
18:31:57.840-18:32:01.040
Did the defendant's conduct fall below the required standard?

Speaker 2: 
18:32:01.280-18:32:05.600
And whether or not there's causation, so was there a breach that caused the plaintiff damage?

Speaker 2: 
18:32:05.840-18:32:07.600
And fourth, was there actually damage?

Speaker 2: 
18:32:07.760-18:32:11.360
So did the plaintiff suffer any compensatable damage?

Speaker 2: 
18:32:11.520-18:32:16.800
So these come from elements of negligence that you will study in tort law or that you have studied in tort law.

Speaker 2: 
18:32:17.040-18:32:20.240
But the plaintiff needs to prove each of these on the balance of probabilities.

Speaker 2: 
18:32:20.480-18:32:24.180
But in order to do that, we need evidence.

Speaker 2: 
18:32:24.500-18:32:28.980
Also, obviously, they can bring up defences, et cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 2: 
18:32:29.299-18:32:41.320
But what we what I feel like is important from this insight is that From this particular case is that pleadings determine the fact in issue.

Speaker 2: 
18:32:41.560-18:32:59.360
So if the plaintiff pleads certain fact And the defendant ultimately denies them in their defence, those become the contested ultimate facts in issue So this is why it's really important because it shapes what the evidence will be and it'll shape how relevant it is throughout the actual case.

Speaker 2: 
18:32:59.680-18:33:09.280
So when you do get your hypothetical situations it will ultimately outline the circumstances or the situation as to what's happened.

Speaker 2: 
18:33:09.520-18:33:17.200
And you'll need to focus on not the criminal law or the civil law, but you'll need to focus on the evidential elements.

Speaker 2: 
18:33:17.620-18:33:17.940
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
18:33:18.500-18:33:24.980
So it's just good to keep in mind though that the foundation is backed by criminal and civil law.

Speaker 2: 
18:33:30.579-18:33:31.220
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
18:33:31.859-18:33:34.099
So primary facts in issue.

Speaker 2: 
18:33:34.740-18:33:37.940
So primary facts are building blocks, essentially.

Speaker 2: 
18:33:38.180-18:33:41.140
So we use these to establish ultimate facts.

Speaker 2: 
18:33:41.539-18:33:47.859
So, I think there was a really good definition provided in the textbook, and it's Anderson textbook.

Speaker 2: 
18:33:48.180-18:33:58.480
And It was defined as facts requiring proof that are not ultimate facts and issue, but once proved will assist the fact finder in deciding an ultimate fact and issue.

Speaker 2: 
18:33:58.520-18:34:01.880
Now I know there's a lot of I think I've said fact about forty five times.

Speaker 2: 
18:34:01.960-18:34:05.880
I'm really verging on the suits, you know, likened to suits here.

Speaker 2: 
18:34:06.760-18:34:09.720
But I think it's really important to understand this.

Speaker 2: 
18:34:09.799-18:34:11.559
And I'll give you a good example.

Speaker 2: 
18:34:12.200-18:34:16.200
I'm going to use a negligence scenario because I feel like it's just good to use.

Speaker 2: 
18:34:16.839-18:34:19.960
All right, say a defendant breached a duty of care in driving.

Speaker 2: 
18:34:20.039-18:34:22.839
So, say the rebel driver breached a duty of care.

Speaker 2: 
18:34:24.280-18:34:31.240
And the primary facts were that the defendant was driving, we'll say, 80 kilometres an hour in a fifty zone.

Speaker 2: 
18:34:31.140-18:34:37.059
The road was red and it was because it was raining recently.

Speaker 2: 
18:34:37.380-18:34:39.859
The defendant was texting while they were driving.

Speaker 2: 
18:34:40.099-18:34:42.900
They didn't break before they entered into an intersection.

Speaker 2: 
18:34:43.220-18:34:45.299
And they'd also been drinking.

Speaker 2: 
18:34:45.140-18:34:46.740
Two hours earlier.

Speaker 2: 
18:34:47.380-18:34:52.900
So, what do we notice about these facts?

Speaker 2: 
18:34:56.420-18:34:58.900
What do these facts tell us?

Speaker 2: 
18:35:03.700-18:35:05.780
Yep, it impaired their ability to drive.

Speaker 2: 
18:35:05.940-18:35:06.340
Yep.

Speaker 2: 
18:35:09.120-18:35:10.080
What else?

Speaker 2: 
18:35:10.720-18:35:12.720
Does it prove that they were negligent?

Speaker 2: 
18:35:16.680-18:35:17.160
Yep.

Speaker 2: 
18:35:17.320-18:35:22.280
So it looks at yep, so it proves that the defe what situation the defendant was in.

Speaker 2: 
18:35:22.920-18:35:25.880
Texting so it gives us a bit of context, doesn't it?

Speaker 2: 
18:35:25.940-18:35:31.140
It can help us to establish the defendant's driving fell below a reasonable standard.

Speaker 2: 
18:35:31.460-18:35:34.980
Now, how, what kind of evidence could we use to establish that?

Speaker 2: 
18:35:35.619-18:35:36.900
So he'd been drinking, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:35:36.980-18:35:38.820
Or she'd been drinking, they've been drinking.

Speaker 2: 
18:35:39.120-18:35:42.320
What could we obtain to establish that?

Speaker 2: 
18:35:45.760-18:35:46.000
Sorry?

Speaker 3: 
18:35:46.240-18:35:47.520
Red side breath test.

Speaker 2: 
18:35:47.720-18:35:48.520
Yep, excellent.

Speaker 2: 
18:35:48.599-18:35:50.279
So we've got some, yep, excellent.

Speaker 2: 
18:35:50.359-18:35:52.279
So we've got breath test, blood alcohol level.

Speaker 2: 
18:35:52.599-18:35:53.960
We've got the road rules.

Speaker 2: 
18:35:54.440-18:35:57.960
Excellent What about the defendant what if the defendant was texting and driving?

Speaker 3: 
18:35:58.360-18:36:05.560
Could see if he was if he was seeing any sentencing could go to his own mobile phone logs like subpoena to them and determine if he'd sent any SMSs during that period of time.

Speaker 2: 
18:36:05.520-18:36:06.160
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
18:36:06.320-18:36:06.480
Yep.

Speaker 2: 
18:36:06.640-18:36:07.760
So we've got excellent, excellent.

Speaker 2: 
18:36:07.839-18:36:10.079
So we've got a couple up so mobile phone records.

Speaker 2: 
18:36:10.560-18:36:12.480
Yep, they could span those texts.

Speaker 2: 
18:36:13.620-18:36:18.500
What about any Okay, what about the road being wet from the rain?

Speaker 2: 
18:36:18.660-18:36:20.660
How do we know about how do we know it was raining?

Speaker 2: 
18:36:21.300-18:36:23.220
How do we know it was wet?

Speaker 2: 
18:36:24.660-18:36:27.620
Yep, there could be a weather report, there could be a police report.

Speaker 2: 
18:36:28.100-18:36:28.500
What else?

Speaker 2: 
18:36:28.660-18:36:30.420
Do we have any what about anyone around?

Speaker 2: 
18:36:30.500-18:36:31.620
Can we use any eyewitnesses?

Speaker 2: 
18:36:31.700-18:36:32.180
Oh, excellent.

Speaker 2: 
18:36:32.260-18:36:34.020
So we've got eyewitnesses.

Speaker 2: 
18:36:34.720-18:36:39.040
What about the fact that the defendant was driving eighty kilometres in a fifty zone?

Speaker 2: 
18:36:39.120-18:36:39.680
How do we know?

Speaker 3: 
18:36:40.000-18:36:40.880
Speed camera.

Speaker 2: 
18:36:41.200-18:36:42.800
Yep, speed cameras, dash cams.

Speaker 2: 
18:36:42.880-18:36:44.700
Excell Lauren.

Speaker 2: 
18:36:45.820-18:36:47.580
If there's an onboard computer, excellent.

Speaker 2: 
18:36:47.740-18:36:50.620
So potentially they have a fancy car, yep, the please could have a look at that.

Speaker 2: 
18:36:50.700-18:36:55.220
Skid marks, excellent All these are like, yep, crash reconstruction.

Speaker 2: 
18:36:55.460-18:36:56.580
Excellent, you're all over it.

Speaker 2: 
18:36:56.820-18:37:03.540
This is the thing, there's so many different kinds of evidence that we can use to establish Situation or a scenario, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:37:04.180-18:37:11.940
So we like to look at them like, so actually, just to rewind just super quickly, and also thank you for all of that because that's fantastic.

Speaker 2: 
18:37:12.120-18:37:14.360
But none of these primary facts itself, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:37:14.440-18:37:19.320
So we look at them from the outset, we've got, okay, the road was wet from rain, they didn't break, they were drinking, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:37:19.560-18:37:27.060
None of these just facts Constitute us proving that there was a breach, but it can help us establish that there might have been.

Speaker 2: 
18:37:27.220-18:37:27.780
Why?

Speaker 2: 
18:37:28.740-18:37:33.780
Because of all the different evidence that can be admitted or collected.

Speaker 2: 
18:37:33.720-18:37:34.279
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
18:37:34.839-18:37:44.279
So generally, and it's explained this way in the learning materials, and I think it's a really good explanation, but it's like links in a chain.

Speaker 2: 
18:37:43.859-18:37:45.780
So, one leads to the next sequence.

Speaker 2: 
18:37:46.020-18:37:54.339
So, another example could be a defendant bought a gun, the defendant was at the scene, the victim was shot with the same kind of gun, the defendant's the shooter.

Speaker 2: 
18:37:54.420-18:37:55.859
So, it's like a link, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:37:56.700-18:38:00.140
You've also got like strands of a cable, which I also liked this example.

Speaker 2: 
18:38:00.460-18:38:14.900
So, multiple facts combined to support one conclusion So an example could be that the defendant's fingerprints plus DNA evidence plus witness identification plus phone records showing their presence equals the defendant being at a scene.

Speaker 2: 
18:38:15.140-18:38:28.360
Just like how all of you put together that we could establish that the defendant was negligently driving by establishing we've got the weather report, it was raining, we've got a blood alcohol reading We've got cameras, for example.

Speaker 2: 
18:38:28.600-18:38:39.799
We might have had subpoenaed documents, text documents from their phone or documentary evidence from their phone So all of these puzzle pieces make up what we're trying to prove.

Speaker 2: 
18:38:40.120-18:38:45.720
So understanding these distinctions are going to help you construct stronger arguments because that's what we need to do.

Speaker 2: 
18:38:45.960-18:38:52.320
We need to make sure that we're looking at the individual pieces of evidence And look at the chain, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:38:52.480-18:38:55.840
Because the chain reasoning is only as strong as its weakest link.

Speaker 2: 
18:38:56.080-18:39:16.960
So if one fact in this sequence might fail, the whole argument could collapse So I would say that there's the chain argument, but there's also I like both of them, the strands of the cable argument I would say that the cable reasoning is a bit more robust because even if one strand breaks, others still could support the conclusion.

Speaker 2: 
18:39:17.120-18:39:33.200
So again, it's like putting your best foot forward But this is why prosecutors in circumstantial cases do prefer a cable style argument because they're less vulnerable to having like a piece of evidence excluded or discredited So hopefully, this is making sense.

Speaker 2: 
18:39:33.840-18:39:35.360
We're almost due for a break.

Speaker 2: 
18:39:35.680-18:39:38.880
Is time flying or is it I don't know, I don't know, hopefully.

Speaker 2: 
18:39:39.120-18:39:47.920
We're kind of almost halfway through If we don't get through all of the content, because I don't want to keep you till 12 a.

Speaker 2: 
18:39:48.080-18:39:48.240
m.

Speaker 2: 
18:39:49.219-18:39:55.620
I'll try my best to get through it all, but ultimately, if it goes too overtime, I really don't know it's going to be like too late.

Speaker 2: 
18:39:55.940-18:39:58.659
I'll still obviously provide you the slides, et cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 2: 
18:39:58.820-18:40:00.020
But let's just see how we go.

Speaker 2: 
18:40:01.000-18:40:03.320
You know, it's kind of difficult, huh?

Speaker 2: 
18:40:03.480-18:40:06.360
Because, you know, there's so much to cover.

Speaker 2: 
18:40:07.000-18:40:09.480
Okay, the logical connection test.

Speaker 2: 
18:40:09.640-18:40:12.740
Now This is a bit of a practical application.

Speaker 2: 
18:40:12.900-18:40:16.900
Now I might do this one and then I'll give you a break.

Speaker 2: 
18:40:17.220-18:40:37.360
So This is a practical application, and what we want to look at is how the courts apply Section fifty five, subsection one, or the relevance test Now the key phrase, like we've discussed, is could rationally affect and understanding what this actually means.

Speaker 2: 
18:40:37.320-18:40:44.920
So, I'm going to just relay an authoritative interpretation, and this is from a case called Papa Cosmos and the Queen.

Speaker 2: 
18:40:45.500-18:40:49.260
very famous case, and you'll become very familiar with it through evidence law.

Speaker 2: 
18:40:49.580-18:40:53.340
And Justice McHugh made a really important point.

Speaker 2: 
18:40:53.320-18:40:56.600
Reliability is not the concern of relevance.

Speaker 2: 
18:40:56.840-18:41:00.360
A concept that is concerned with logical oh, sorry.

Speaker 2: 
18:41:03.280-18:41:09.920
Reliability is not the concern of relevance, a concept that is concerned with logic and experience.

Speaker 2: 
18:41:10.240-18:41:17.040
Ultimately, what this means is we don't evidence reliable or should the jury believe it.

Speaker 2: 
18:41:17.360-18:41:23.760
We ask, if the jury accepted this evidence, could it logically help them decide a fact and issue?

Speaker 2: 
18:41:24.780-18:41:29.580
Now this was also reinforced in another case called Festa and the Queen.

Speaker 2: 
18:41:29.659-18:41:31.739
Now these are really famous evidence cases.

Speaker 2: 
18:41:32.060-18:41:33.659
I learned them when I was at uni.

Speaker 2: 
18:41:33.820-18:41:39.600
They're just They're great too, you know, in terms of strengthening your understanding of the evidence law.

Speaker 2: 
18:41:39.920-18:41:47.360
But in FESTA, Chief Justice Gleason addressed the common mistake that is often made.

Speaker 2: 
18:41:48.340-18:41:58.020
If evidence is of some, albeit slight, probative value, that it is admissible unless some principle of exclusion comes to play to justify withholding it from a jury.

Speaker 2: 
18:41:58.260-18:42:01.540
So it's not enough to just say that it's weak, ultimately.

Speaker 2: 
18:42:01.619-18:42:06.820
So the judge's role in relevance determination is actually very specific.

Speaker 2: 
18:42:07.139-18:42:15.699
So a trial judge needs to assume the fact finder or the jury will attach some probative value to the evidence.

Speaker 2: 
18:42:15.840-18:42:25.920
And they also need to ask, would it be reasonably open to the fact finder to use this evidence to determine whether a facting issue actually exists?

Speaker 2: 
18:42:27.160-18:42:34.760
So it's important to note as well that a judge doesn't decide if the evidence is relevant, okay?

Speaker 2: 
18:42:35.320-18:42:38.360
They decide if it could be relevant.

Speaker 2: 
18:42:38.699-18:42:41.739
Relevant to a reasonable fact finder acting reasonably.

Speaker 2: 
18:42:41.980-18:42:45.659
So we can say something's relevant, but what we want to know really is could it be relevant?

Speaker 2: 
18:42:45.820-18:42:53.740
Could it be relevant to establishing an ultimate fact in issue So there's another example from the case of Neil and the Queen.

Speaker 2: 
18:42:54.380-18:43:04.460
Now, this is a good example because the question was whether evidence of a sexless marriage was relevant to charges of sexual acts with a seven year old child.

Speaker 2: 
18:43:04.780-18:43:21.320
Now in this particular case, and obviously a very serious case, but in this particular case, Justice Crawford reasoned, will men who suffer an unhappy marriage have more reason to commit sexual acts against young children than men who enjoy a happy, satisfying marriage.

Speaker 2: 
18:43:21.640-18:43:25.100
With some hesitation I concluded that the answer is affirmative.

Speaker 2: 
18:43:25.260-18:43:28.140
So that's what Chief Justice sorry, that's what Justice Crawford said.

Speaker 2: 
18:43:28.460-18:43:34.060
So notice the hesitation because it shows how courts can struggle with borderline relevance, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:43:34.100-18:43:55.520
The connection was weak and relied on controversial assumptions about human behaviour, but it met the minimal threshold for a logical connection So ultimately, this example illustrates how relevance determinations can reflect broader assumptions or societal assumptions and values embedded in legal reasoning.

Speaker 2: 
18:43:55.680-18:44:01.199
So how we use social assumptions, human behavior, to embed them in legal reasoning.

Speaker 2: 
18:44:01.360-18:44:03.199
So we need to be really careful about that.

Speaker 2: 
18:44:03.360-18:44:04.559
Does that make sense?

Speaker 2: 
18:44:08.219-18:44:10.619
Neil and the Queen's a really important case as well.

Speaker 2: 
18:44:10.940-18:44:14.300
So I would recommend looking into that.

Speaker 2: 
18:44:14.460-18:44:16.059
I'll just chat.

Speaker 2: 
18:44:16.380-18:44:16.860
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
18:44:18.599-18:44:20.440
So someone being a terrible book is relevant.

Speaker 2: 
18:44:20.520-18:44:22.840
Well, if it goes to character evidence, potentially.

Speaker 2: 
18:44:23.159-18:44:23.719
Potentially.

Speaker 2: 
18:44:23.880-18:44:24.440
That's right.

Speaker 2: 
18:44:24.760-18:44:25.559
So it can.

Speaker 2: 
18:44:26.820-18:44:28.660
So I would great question.

Speaker 2: 
18:44:28.900-18:44:33.700
And how about a woman's cloth in sexual assault cases?

Speaker 2: 
18:44:34.340-18:44:43.360
Do you mean like whether or not There was evidence of so, for example, DNA.

Speaker 2: 
18:44:43.679-18:44:44.239
Sorry.

Speaker 2: 
18:44:46.240-18:44:48.240
Can everyone oh, yep, sure, no worries.

Speaker 2: 
18:44:48.560-18:44:50.240
So, how about women's clothings?

Speaker 2: 
18:44:50.320-18:45:05.380
Yes, it could be if there is DNA evidence or if there's, say, for example, they were wearing a particular item of clothing and it was called on CCTV and they were able to identify that the accused was in fact speaking to that person earlier on in the evening, for example, and they were wearing the same clothing.

Speaker 2: 
18:45:05.540-18:45:06.579
Yes, it could be.

Speaker 2: 
18:45:06.460-18:45:11.900
So it's all about really going, really, I guess, going deeper into the surface.

Speaker 2: 
18:45:12.059-18:45:13.260
So we go beyond the surface.

Speaker 2: 
18:45:13.340-18:45:18.540
So think about it like we've got the scenario, but like, how do we put together the puzzle pieces?

Speaker 2: 
18:45:18.640-18:45:28.400
Like I like to think about like when you get a new puzzle, I use a lot of metaphors, but you get a new puzzle and you tip out the box on the table and you've got to sort through all these different things, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:45:28.940-18:45:31.740
Eventually, you might find a puzzle piece that connects to another.

Speaker 2: 
18:45:32.060-18:45:34.620
But say, for example, you buy a puzzle from an op shop, right?

Speaker 2: 
18:45:34.780-18:45:39.580
And it might be missing some puzzle pieces, and you might not be able to complete the whole puzzle.

Speaker 2: 
18:45:39.540-18:45:42.820
It's about looking below the surface, yeah.

Speaker 2: 
18:45:43.460-18:45:46.179
Now, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give you all a break because it's 6:50.

Speaker 2: 
18:45:46.260-18:45:51.540
So, we're basically like halfway through, which is exciting for you because I can imagine you're probably all hungry.

Speaker 2: 
18:45:51.719-18:45:53.239
Alrighty, so it's 6.

Speaker 2: 
18:45:53.320-18:45:55.239
48 now.

Speaker 2: 
18:45:56.120-18:45:57.560
Do you want to all come back at like 7.

Speaker 2: 
18:45:57.640-18:45:58.840
05?

Speaker 4: 
18:46:02.300-18:46:03.660
Does that sound okay?

Speaker 4: 
18:46:04.940-18:46:05.260
All right.

Speaker 4: 
18:46:05.420-18:46:06.860
Hopefully that's long enough.

Speaker 4: 
18:46:07.340-18:46:08.700
Stretch your legs.

Speaker 4: 
18:46:09.500-18:46:12.780
You know, give your ears a break for having to listen to me, harp on.

Speaker 4: 
18:46:13.100-18:46:17.580
But I will see you all in like 17 minutes.

Speaker 4: 
18:46:17.820-18:46:18.460
Yep, I think.

Speaker 4: 
18:46:18.540-18:46:20.300
I'm pretty bad at math, but I think that's about it.

Speaker 4: 
18:46:20.380-18:46:21.820
All right, see you all soon.

Speaker 4: 
19:02:53.680-19:02:56.240
Hello, hi, welcome back.

Speaker 4: 
19:02:56.400-19:02:57.520
Hi, Mark.

Speaker 4: 
19:02:58.160-19:03:00.480
All right, is everyone back with me?

Speaker 4: 
19:03:02.220-19:03:02.860
Awesome.

Speaker 4: 
19:03:03.020-19:03:11.660
Okay, hopefully you all feel a bit more like alive after having a little break.

Speaker 2: 
19:03:12.780-19:03:14.140
Excellent, good.

Speaker 2: 
19:03:14.460-19:03:18.700
And obviously, feel free to take breaks if you need.

Speaker 2: 
19:03:19.180-19:03:23.580
Go stand up, stretch your legs, get water and do what you need to do.

Speaker 2: 
19:03:23.660-19:03:29.320
I know it's a long session, but Hopefully, everyone's feeling all right.

Speaker 2: 
19:03:29.960-19:03:39.159
So have there been any sort of questions or queries about anything that we've covered just before we get back into the rest of the content?

Speaker 2: 
19:03:45.900-19:03:48.460
If not, that is totally fine.

Speaker 2: 
19:03:49.740-19:03:57.180
You can always, like I said, email me and or send me a message on Canvas.

Speaker 2: 
19:03:57.500-19:04:00.060
So actually, I might just make a quick note about that.

Speaker 2: 
19:04:00.300-19:04:05.840
So In terms of emails, oh, amazing.

Speaker 2: 
19:04:06.159-19:04:09.360
So Russell's made a cool flowchart, which is fantastic.

Speaker 2: 
19:04:09.679-19:04:12.280
Oh And that's so nice that you want to share it as well.

Speaker 2: 
19:04:12.520-19:04:15.000
I mean, I love I love when everyone's like super collaborative.

Speaker 2: 
19:04:15.160-19:04:15.880
I think that's awesome.

Speaker 2: 
19:04:16.040-19:04:18.840
And particularly because site, you'll help each other.

Speaker 2: 
19:04:18.360-19:04:19.800
And I think that's awesome.

Speaker 2: 
19:04:20.760-19:04:30.760
You can always post it in the main discussion board forum, or you can send it to me, and I can distribute it and let everyone know that you've made it, and that's great.

Speaker 2: 
19:04:30.920-19:04:33.000
So, thank you for doing that.

Speaker 2: 
19:04:34.120-19:04:39.560
In terms of communicating with me, absolutely gold star.

Speaker 2: 
19:04:39.640-19:04:40.760
I wish there was an emoji.

Speaker 2: 
19:04:40.920-19:04:42.440
Actually, maybe there is.

Speaker 2: 
19:04:45.280-19:04:45.920
Yay.

Speaker 2: 
19:04:46.800-19:04:47.920
Gold star.

Speaker 2: 
19:04:48.480-19:04:49.200
All righty.

Speaker 2: 
19:04:50.160-19:05:01.840
So in terms of emailing me, I try to get back to your emails the best that I can, within 24 to 48 hours at the most.

Speaker 2: 
19:05:02.160-19:05:07.840
If you have so I get I do get quite a few emails, and that's just, you know, I guess just the nature of the job.

Speaker 2: 
19:05:08.920-19:05:12.440
But I will always try to get back to you, ASAP.

Speaker 2: 
19:05:12.760-19:05:16.520
If you haven't heard from me, just send me a follow-up.

Speaker 2: 
19:05:17.080-19:05:18.280
Hopefully, you won't have to do that.

Speaker 2: 
19:05:18.440-19:05:21.160
But if you if you need to, just do it.

Speaker 2: 
19:05:21.300-19:05:23.780
You know, I will be like, oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

Speaker 2: 
19:05:25.380-19:05:33.140
But otherwise, Canvas messages are also another good way to I get more emails than Canvas messages, if that makes sense.

Speaker 2: 
19:05:33.460-19:05:39.260
So If you do communicate with me through Canvas message, that's also another way to do it.

Speaker 2: 
19:05:40.699-19:05:50.360
I try to have like one normally on the weekend, at least one screen free day just because I think it's always important to do that.

Speaker 2: 
19:05:50.680-19:05:52.680
So if you haven't heard from me, that's okay.

Speaker 5: 
19:05:52.840-19:05:53.720
I will get back to you.

Speaker 2: 
19:05:53.800-19:05:55.880
But yep, always within twenty four to forty eight hours.

Speaker 2: 
19:05:56.040-19:06:02.520
If it's urgent, just write urgent in the subject line, like in capital letters, and I'll see it.

Speaker 2: 
19:06:02.680-19:06:07.480
But yeah, just letting you know, I'll always try to get back to you ASAP.

Speaker 2: 
19:06:08.260-19:06:11.059
Yeah, within at least 24 to 48 hours.

Speaker 2: 
19:06:11.380-19:06:16.179
Okay, so let's get back into learning about evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:06:16.340-19:06:19.780
All right, so we're going to go to types of evidence now.

Speaker 2: 
19:06:20.260-19:06:27.540
So as we've probably already, I guess, learned, evidence comes in very different forms.

Speaker 2: 
19:06:27.620-19:06:30.260
So there's heaps of different kinds of evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:06:30.020-19:06:42.500
And throughout this teaching period, we're going to be focusing on the different kinds of evidence in line with the Victorian Legal Admissions Board's requirements or essentially the Legal Services Board requirements.

Speaker 2: 
19:06:42.460-19:06:44.540
which can be found in your syllabus as well.

Speaker 2: 
19:06:44.620-19:06:47.100
So what we're going to be covering is in your syllabus.

Speaker 2: 
19:06:47.420-19:07:05.460
It's just to make sure that you have a really comprehensive understanding of the evidence law because You know, it's very strict because it is a priestly subject, and a priestly subject is a very all subjects are important, but priestly subjects are, of course, the core units of the study of law.

Speaker 2: 
19:07:06.040-19:07:12.120
So when it comes to evidence itself, we will be discussing each week.

Speaker 2: 
19:07:12.199-19:07:15.560
So we might look at so one week will be specifically on hearsay evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:07:15.719-19:07:18.040
The next week might be on opinion evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:07:18.360-19:07:20.640
One week might be on opinion Say opinion.

Speaker 2: 
19:07:20.720-19:07:21.280
Pinion, sorry.

Speaker 2: 
19:07:21.440-19:07:22.800
Next week might be on character evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:07:22.960-19:07:26.000
The week after that, it might be on another form.

Speaker 2: 
19:07:26.240-19:07:30.000
So you get a really comprehensive understanding of the different types of evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:07:30.840-19:07:39.480
Often in your exam questions, your hypotheticals, and of course, I'll give you a lot of guidance, it'll often encompass a few different kinds of evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:07:39.640-19:07:43.400
So it won't just be necessarily on one piece of evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:07:43.219-19:07:55.380
It might ask you to deem the admissibility or the relevance of identification evidence coupled with the relevance and admissibility of documentary evidence, for example.

Speaker 2: 
19:07:55.520-19:07:59.440
So you will, of course, need to spot those issues.

Speaker 2: 
19:07:59.680-19:08:05.200
And after we learn over the next twelve weeks, you're going to be all over it, I promise.

Speaker 2: 
19:08:05.680-19:08:21.840
So evidence comes in very different forms, and it's important to understand the categories because it will help us apply relevance principles really effectively So there are generally three main classification systems that are used.

Speaker 2: 
19:08:22.480-19:08:27.679
First, we distinguish between testimony, documents and hearsay.

Speaker 2: 
19:08:27.520-19:08:32.880
So this will be about the format or vehicle through which the evidence will reach court.

Speaker 2: 
19:08:33.680-19:08:39.800
Secondly, we distinguish between real and demonstrative evidence from other types of evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:08:40.040-19:08:49.560
So this is about whether the fact finder or the jury, and I'll refer to them interchangeably, perceives the evidence directly or through witness description.

Speaker 2: 
19:08:49.800-19:08:56.059
So Can anyone think of an example of a demonstrative piece of evidence in court?

Speaker 2: 
19:08:59.820-19:09:00.460
A video?

Speaker 2: 
19:09:00.619-19:09:03.739
Yep, so that could be a form of documentary evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:09:08.020-19:09:09.780
So what about the do you remember O.

Speaker 2: 
19:09:09.860-19:09:09.940
J.

Speaker 2: 
19:09:10.100-19:09:11.300
Simpson, the case of O.

Speaker 2: 
19:09:11.460-19:09:11.540
J.

Speaker 2: 
19:09:11.620-19:09:16.180
Simpson, who also subsequently wrote a book called If I Did the Murder?

Speaker 2: 
19:09:16.420-19:09:16.660
Yes.

Speaker 2: 
19:09:16.900-19:09:26.040
So So in the case of OJ Simpson, right, very famous case, well documented across all forms of media.

Speaker 2: 
19:09:26.800-19:09:33.200
Also famously correlated to the glove, the glove, so if the glove fits.

Speaker 2: 
19:09:33.520-19:09:36.320
Now controversial case Of course, O.

Speaker 2: 
19:09:36.400-19:09:36.480
J.

Speaker 2: 
19:09:36.640-19:09:49.600
Simpson was found not guilty in criminal court, but subsequently won in the civil jurisdiction, which, of course, is why the law is so important because we have different avenues of finding legal redress Now in the O.

Speaker 2: 
19:09:49.760-19:09:49.840
J.

Speaker 2: 
19:09:50.000-19:09:56.240
Simpson case, the glove, as you've pointed out, O.

Speaker 2: 
19:09:56.400-19:09:56.640
J.

Speaker 2: 
19:09:56.960-19:09:58.640
provided what did he do in court?

Speaker 2: 
19:09:58.720-19:10:00.480
What did he do with the glove in court?

Speaker 2: 
19:10:05.699-19:10:06.579
Right, exactly.

Speaker 2: 
19:10:06.739-19:10:07.940
So he put the glove on.

Speaker 2: 
19:10:08.099-19:10:10.579
He tried it on in front of the jury.

Speaker 2: 
19:10:10.820-19:10:13.540
Now, this is like demonstrative evidence, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:10:13.700-19:10:15.140
So he put it on in front of the jury.

Speaker 2: 
19:10:15.220-19:10:16.260
And what was he trying to prove?

Speaker 2: 
19:10:16.340-19:10:21.700
Or what did his defence team try to prove about this glove that was found at the scene?

Speaker 2: 
19:10:26.780-19:10:27.820
Yeah, it wouldn't fit him.

Speaker 5: 
19:10:27.900-19:10:30.540
And I'm sorry, I think sorry, yep, Cheryl noted.

Speaker 2: 
19:10:30.620-19:10:35.100
And yep, so that the glove wasn't his, it didn't belong to him, it didn't fit.

Speaker 2: 
19:10:35.260-19:10:47.860
Now I heard some like rumors swirling around, and it's probably the thing, but like his defense team said that oh no, someone said that someone, someone in the media, said that his defence team

Speaker 5: 
19:10:47.719-19:10:53.159
Told him to stop taking his arthritis medication, so his hands swelled up, and therefore the glove didn't fit.

Speaker 2: 
19:10:53.320-19:11:03.120
Now, course, all speculation But again, his defence team were like, let's put the glove on in front of the jury to show that it wasn't him that was wearing the glove.

Speaker 2: 
19:11:03.200-19:11:06.720
So this could be a form of demonstrative evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:11:06.680-19:11:12.120
This is how the jury will perceive evidence directly, and it's really, really interesting.

Speaker 2: 
19:11:12.360-19:11:16.680
Also, oh, Mason said he also wore a latex glove underneath the leather glove.

Speaker 2: 
19:11:16.840-19:11:17.560
There you go.

Speaker 2: 
19:11:17.880-19:11:19.640
So, another interesting thing.

Speaker 2: 
19:11:20.720-19:11:25.760
And Judith said, it wasn't him wearing the glove used in the commission of crime.

Speaker 2: 
19:11:25.840-19:11:26.240
That's right.

Speaker 2: 
19:11:26.480-19:11:33.020
So interestingly, there'll be a number of different ways that every is presented to a jury.

Speaker 2: 
19:11:33.340-19:11:37.100
That's an example of one of those pieces of evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:11:37.740-19:11:40.380
Sometimes there's a case of Jennifer Pan.

Speaker 2: 
19:11:40.460-19:11:42.380
I'm sorry, I'm using a lot of US examples.

Speaker 2: 
19:11:42.540-19:11:47.840
I'm just a I like to read a lot about in you know cross-jurisdictional cases.

Speaker 2: 
19:11:48.320-19:12:05.560
Jennifer Pan, there was also a documentary on this where She was found guilty of murdering both of her parents, but what she did was try to stage a home invasion And she'd actually contracted two people to go in and kill her parents.

Speaker 2: 
19:12:06.120-19:12:25.140
One of her parents, her father, survived But what they did in court was as well as in interrogation, which they did, I believe they may have played to the jury as well as they tried to get her to demonstrate how she was tied up and how she was able to reach the phone to call police because it all wasn't adding up.

Speaker 2: 
19:12:25.380-19:12:33.739
So these are different kinds of how evidence Presented, sorry, this is how different kinds of evidence may be presented to a jury.

Speaker 2: 
19:12:34.699-19:12:40.420
Interesting case, though, very sad case, but I would have a oh my gosh, the perm, yes, Hannah.

Speaker 2: 
19:12:40.579-19:12:41.540
Sorry, great example.

Speaker 2: 
19:12:41.780-19:12:42.340
The perm.

Speaker 2: 
19:12:42.420-19:12:47.219
Okay, if you haven't watched Legally Born, which I feel is just a rite of passage if you're a law student.

Speaker 2: 
19:12:46.940-19:12:47.820
Or just a lawyer.

Speaker 2: 
19:12:48.380-19:12:49.900
You need to watch Legally Blonde.

Speaker 2: 
19:12:49.980-19:12:53.180
And the perm scene at the end is just amazing.

Speaker 2: 
19:12:54.220-19:12:57.260
I feel like, you know, sorry, you just reminded me.

Speaker 2: 
19:12:57.160-19:12:57.880
Really random story.

Speaker 2: 
19:12:57.960-19:13:00.600
I remember once my parents came to, because they were going to have lunch with me at court.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:00.760-19:13:03.160
I remember they came to watch me in court one day.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:03.480-19:13:06.760
And they were literally like when her two friends walk in, they're like, oh, it's so cute.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:06.920-19:13:07.480
There's like a judge.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:07.640-19:13:11.460
And I was like, please sit down Anyways, that just always reminds me of that scene.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:13.060-19:13:15.220
Oh, my cousin Vinny is also.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:15.300-19:13:16.420
I haven't seen that movie.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:16.660-19:13:17.780
Oh, I really want to watch that.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:17.860-19:13:18.420
I haven't seen it.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:18.740-19:13:19.940
I've heard about this movie.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:20.180-19:13:22.580
I'm going to put that on my list.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:23.080-19:13:23.720
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:23.880-19:13:24.280
Thank you.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:24.680-19:13:27.640
I love all the yes, any recommendations, please keep them coming.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:27.800-19:13:29.000
I've got an ulterior motive.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:29.160-19:13:31.320
I just really want some more things to read and watch.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:31.640-19:13:32.680
So please do share.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:32.840-19:13:37.180
Do share any documentaries, podcasts Books Amongst All of Us.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:37.340-19:13:38.620
Very interesting.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:40.380-19:13:43.580
Also, too, by the way, there is a really good podcast.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:44.740-19:13:46.740
It's called Heading to the Bar.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:47.700-19:13:50.900
It also goes through different kinds of evidence and how it's applied.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:51.060-19:13:55.700
If you just, I thought it was a really good podcast done by some members of the Victorian Bar.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:55.940-19:13:56.660
But yeah.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:57.020-19:13:58.540
All right, even to watch that movie.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:58.620-19:13:59.820
We'll discuss that next week.

Speaker 2: 
19:13:59.900-19:14:03.100
I'll put that on the agenda as well.

Speaker 2: 
19:14:03.820-19:14:21.719
So then first, just back on track, sorry, we distinguish between direct and circumstantial evid So directing circumstantial evidence, ultimately, is about the logical relationship between the evidence and the facts that we're trying to prove So all of these categories are not mutually exclusive.

Speaker 2: 
19:14:22.040-19:14:33.360
So a single piece of evidence might be testimony, it might be circumstantial, it might be used to prove a primary fact that can help us Establish an ultimate fact and issue.

Speaker 2: 
19:14:33.679-19:14:38.239
So, the foundation rule applies regardless of the type of evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:14:38.559-19:14:42.079
So, everything must be relevant under section 55.

Speaker 2: 
19:14:42.140-19:14:49.100
However, different types of evidence present differently under different types of relevance, for example.

Speaker 2: 
19:14:49.260-19:14:52.780
So there's different challenges that come with actually proving its relevance.

Speaker 2: 
19:14:53.140-19:14:57.780
So I guess an example could be direct evidence, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:14:57.860-19:15:05.940
So direct evidence usually has obvious relevance if it's credible But determining its weight could be the main challenge.

Speaker 2: 
19:15:06.260-19:15:13.640
So for example, if there's a knife found at a crime scene, right, but say it has No DNA on the knife.

Speaker 2: 
19:15:13.880-19:15:21.240
Well, okay, it might be obvious that it was used to commit a crime because it was there, but like, how much weight do we give it if there's no DNA?

Speaker 2: 
19:15:21.560-19:15:24.120
Okay, so then you've also got circumstantial evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:15:25.960-19:15:40.620
on the other part of this, which requires, how do I say it, like complex chains of reasoning to establish relevance But once it's actually admitted, it can be really powerful cumulatively.

Speaker 2: 
19:15:41.260-19:15:44.140
Oh, the Susan Neal Fraser case.

Speaker 2: 
19:15:45.020-19:15:47.180
Can you remind me about what that one is?

Speaker 6: 
19:16:04.520-19:16:05.400
Oh, wow.

Speaker 6: 
19:16:05.560-19:16:07.480
Actually, this is coming back to me.

Speaker 6: 
19:16:08.120-19:16:09.480
Oh, Tasmania.

Speaker 6: 
19:16:09.800-19:16:10.920
Oh, okay.

Speaker 2: 
19:16:12.440-19:16:15.639
I will be looking I feel like this sounds very familiar.

Speaker 2: 
19:16:15.719-19:16:19.239
With when I feel like when was this?

Speaker 2: 
19:16:19.400-19:16:25.559
Was this like a few years ago, like twenty eleven, ten ish maybe?

Speaker 2: 
19:16:26.960-19:16:28.800
Yes, okay, okay, Ellie.

Speaker 2: 
19:16:28.880-19:16:29.120
All right.

Speaker 2: 
19:16:29.200-19:16:30.400
I'll have a look into it.

Speaker 2: 
19:16:31.360-19:16:34.560
So Lawrence noted there was a case of Susan Neil Fraser.

Speaker 2: 
19:16:34.640-19:16:37.520
Apparently, it's really interesting from an evidence perspective, which is awesome.

Speaker 2: 
19:16:37.680-19:16:45.860
So any case that you can use to, I guess, learn a bit more and apply evidence, highly recommend.

Speaker 2: 
19:16:46.180-19:16:47.140
Thank you for sharing that.

Speaker 2: 
19:16:47.300-19:16:48.980
It sounds like a really sad case.

Speaker 2: 
19:16:49.380-19:16:55.140
I like it's It's really sad because you will obviously read a lot of sensitive content and materials.

Speaker 2: 
19:16:55.780-19:16:57.860
But again, always really interesting.

Speaker 2: 
19:16:58.020-19:16:59.780
So thank you for sharing.

Speaker 2: 
19:16:59.740-19:17:00.300
Oh, wow.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:00.460-19:17:02.860
She only granted parole like three years ago.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:03.100-19:17:03.580
Crazy.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:03.820-19:17:05.900
I'm going to I've got a lot of homework now.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:06.060-19:17:11.020
I'm going to look at the movie, watch look at this one as well.

Speaker 5: 
19:17:11.340-19:17:13.260
It's very, very interesting.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:14.560-19:17:15.040
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:15.600-19:17:22.160
So basically, I guess the main oh, I've got a book recommendation.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:22.320-19:17:23.520
Okay, witness.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:23.619-19:17:25.619
I'm not kidding, I am writing all these down.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:25.860-19:17:26.739
So, have it.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:27.059-19:17:27.699
Ooh, okay.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:27.860-19:17:32.099
So, Mason's noted that there's a book called Witness by Louise Milligan.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:32.420-19:17:33.300
I will be reading it.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:33.380-19:17:34.579
I love to read.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:36.380-19:17:36.940
This is great.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:37.020-19:17:37.659
Thanks, everyone.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:37.900-19:17:38.780
And thanks for sharing.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:38.940-19:17:40.300
This is awesome.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:40.940-19:17:41.340
All right.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:41.500-19:17:56.420
So when it comes to the different types of evidence, understanding The distinctions will essentially help you identify what kind of relevance arguments you're going to need to make and what challenges you might likely have faced from your opponents or defence.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:56.800-19:17:58.400
or the prosecution.

Speaker 2: 
19:17:58.720-19:18:06.080
So not only when you are formulating an argument, you need to always Think ahead.

Speaker 2: 
19:18:06.320-19:18:11.520
You kind of need to think about it from the other side and anticipate what the other side might say.

Speaker 2: 
19:18:11.840-19:18:12.880
So keep that in mind.

Speaker 2: 
19:18:12.960-19:18:14.720
You can't just look at it through a single lens.

Speaker 2: 
19:18:14.880-19:18:17.680
It always has to be, but what if, but what if, but what if.

Speaker 2: 
19:18:18.020-19:18:22.820
kind of think about it like a psychic kind of like you know thinking.

Speaker 2: 
19:18:23.060-19:18:32.100
It's got to go back around and think about how it can be disputed because that's really important we do look for when we're marking your assessments as well.

Speaker 2: 
19:18:33.579-19:18:38.619
Alrighty, so direct versus circumstantial evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:18:39.260-19:18:39.820
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
19:18:40.139-19:18:43.260
Everyone familiar with circumstantial evidence?

Speaker 2: 
19:18:50.500-19:18:51.620
Yep, yep, yep.

Speaker 2: 
19:18:51.780-19:18:52.980
Excellent, excellent.

Speaker 2: 
19:18:53.300-19:19:03.000
It's a very interesting part of evidence law and the distinction between direct and circumstantial fundamental to legal reasoning.

Speaker 2: 
19:19:03.560-19:19:09.000
So if we look at an authoritative definition from Festa, and Festa's come up before.

Speaker 2: 
19:19:09.420-19:19:15.580
But direct evidence here is evidence which, if accepted, tends to prove a fact and issue.

Speaker 2: 
19:19:17.699-19:19:24.100
is evidence which, if accepted, tends to prove a fact from which the existence of a fact and issue may be inferred.

Speaker 2: 
19:19:24.260-19:19:26.820
Now again, a bit of a mouthful of words.

Speaker 2: 
19:19:26.820-19:19:41.340
But I guess the fundamental element here is the key difference is the logical relationship to the facts in issue So if that was an example of direct evidence, you say, I saw the defendant hit the victim.

Speaker 2: 
19:19:41.500-19:19:46.940
Now if this is believed, it directly proves the defendant committed assault.

Speaker 2: 
19:19:46.680-19:19:53.240
So if there's a defendant's confession, for example, if it's a genuine confession, then it can directly prove guilt.

Speaker 2: 
19:19:53.560-19:20:01.860
If there's CCTV footage of a crime and if it's authentic and obtained properly, it directly shows what happened.

Speaker 2: 
19:20:02.179-19:20:13.480
So it's important to notice that direct evidence will still require the jury to make credibility assess But if they actually accept the evidence, it will directly establish the fact, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:20:13.640-19:20:29.699
So whether or not a defendant committed assault, well if it's accepted by the jury and we accept that eyewitness testimony or we accept that a defendant's made a confession, for example, and it's accepted, then certainly we can establish that fact.

Speaker 2: 
19:20:29.920-19:20:32.080
Now circumstantial evidence examples.

Speaker 2: 
19:20:32.320-19:20:44.260
So I would probably say with circumstantial evidence So, say, for example, there's the defendant's fingerprints at a crime scene.

Speaker 2: 
19:20:44.579-19:20:53.059
So, it might suggest their presence, but it also requires inferences about timing and the purpose of why they were there.

Speaker 2: 
19:20:53.140-19:20:56.420
You've also got a defendant maybe fleeing, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:20:56.500-19:20:59.460
So say if police arrive, the defendant flees.

Speaker 2: 
19:20:59.780-19:21:06.659
So this could suggest consciousness of guilt, but we require an inference as to why.

Speaker 2: 
19:21:06.840-19:21:10.280
You've also got, say, the defendant's bloodstained clothing.

Speaker 2: 
19:21:10.520-19:21:17.160
So this could suggest involvement in a crime, but requires inference about how the blood actually got there.

Speaker 2: 
19:21:17.260-19:21:20.220
Graham's noted circumstantial evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:21:20.860-19:21:31.100
Yes, Blue sorry, Blue, Beau Lemaire Condon, allegedly killing Jesse Baird, I'm so sorry, I'm butchering the names, Baird, and Luke Davis at the shop footage of him buying surfboard.

Speaker 2: 
19:21:31.340-19:21:31.980
Oh, exactly.

Speaker 2: 
19:21:32.699-19:21:41.179
That's a really important example of We've also got the case of thank you for sharing that, Graham.

Speaker 2: 
19:21:41.420-19:21:44.060
We've also got the case of Samantha Murphy, for example.

Speaker 2: 
19:21:44.300-19:21:58.780
I believe that Samantha Murphy Had obviously a woman who disappeared and allegedly been murdered in the Victorian region, and it's largely a circumstantial case.

Speaker 2: 
19:21:58.860-19:22:00.619
They have obviously arrested a charged person.

Speaker 2: 
19:22:00.699-19:22:02.940
I understand that's going to trial next year.

Speaker 2: 
19:22:03.660-19:22:12.620
But circumstantial evidence cases, particularly where it involves a homicide, are very rare and very difficult to prove.

Speaker 2: 
19:22:12.780-19:22:17.619
I believe the last or one of the last cases In Victoria was in the year 2000.

Speaker 2: 
19:22:17.860-19:22:22.500
And I think it had to do with a contract law killing, like a contract killing, essentially.

Speaker 2: 
19:22:22.820-19:22:23.540
Contract law.

Speaker 2: 
19:22:23.699-19:22:23.940
Sorry.

Speaker 2: 
19:22:24.099-19:22:32.679
My class before this was a contract Law class, but I meant contract killing, where I think they were able to apprehend two people involved, but they didn't have a body.

Speaker 2: 
19:22:33.000-19:22:35.960
So it's a very difficult threshold.

Speaker 2: 
19:22:36.540-19:22:38.060
But thank you for sharing that, Graham.

Speaker 2: 
19:22:38.140-19:22:50.600
I think there are, it's really interesting to learn about circumstantial evidence and how that does transpire in court So it's often assumed that direct evidence is better than circumstantial evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:22:50.760-19:22:51.239
What do you think?

Speaker 2: 
19:22:51.320-19:22:54.679
Do you think direct evidence would be better than circumstantial evidence?

Speaker 2: 
19:23:00.219-19:23:01.659
Yes, yep.

Speaker 2: 
19:23:02.300-19:23:03.099
Yep.

Speaker 2: 
19:23:03.739-19:23:06.300
So that's the thing, there's always a mixed bag of responses.

Speaker 2: 
19:23:06.460-19:23:09.099
So not always, it depends, and yes.

Speaker 2: 
19:23:09.340-19:23:12.220
And that's the thing that's going to depend on the case.

Speaker 2: 
19:23:13.180-19:23:24.620
But I would say that it may not always be the c Now direct evidence like eyewitness identification could be notoriously unreliable.

Speaker 2: 
19:23:24.940-19:23:26.460
And this is due to what factors?

Speaker 2: 
19:23:26.540-19:23:26.940
What do you think?

Speaker 2: 
19:23:27.020-19:23:28.860
What do we look at when we look at oh, here we go.

Speaker 2: 
19:23:28.940-19:23:29.659
Sorry, I've got some comments.

Speaker 2: 
19:23:29.739-19:23:31.739
I just want to make sure I'm reading all of your comments.

Speaker 2: 
19:23:31.619-19:23:34.820
So, circumstantial evidence works better.

Speaker 2: 
19:23:35.300-19:23:37.380
Direct evidence is less able to be challenged.

Speaker 2: 
19:23:37.540-19:23:41.219
Credibility, yes, in some cases, circumstantial evidence cannot be proven.

Speaker 2: 
19:23:41.540-19:23:43.139
Helen Munnings is one of those cases.

Speaker 2: 
19:23:43.460-19:23:48.680
Excellent So you've got some really good perceptions of these kinds of evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:23:49.000-19:23:57.000
Now for example, when we look at direct evidence, so say we're looking at eyewitness identification, say you witness a crime.

Speaker 2: 
19:23:57.100-19:24:00.540
Why would why do you think it might be notoriously unreliable?

Speaker 2: 
19:24:00.780-19:24:03.420
Why do you think eyewitness identification is?

Speaker 2: 
19:24:03.580-19:24:05.500
Yes, it can be impaired, absolutely.

Speaker 2: 
19:24:05.820-19:24:06.700
And how so?

Speaker 2: 
19:24:06.860-19:24:08.860
What kind of factors are we looking at?

Speaker 2: 
19:24:17.480-19:24:22.599
Yep, subjectivity, yep, visibility, perception, memory, excellent, the relationship.

Speaker 2: 
19:24:22.920-19:24:24.940
So we've got Amazing.

Speaker 2: 
19:24:25.020-19:24:31.340
So, we've got may not be able to recall the facts, influence of drug or alcohol in the memory, reliability of the eyewitness association.

Speaker 2: 
19:24:31.820-19:24:41.720
Hannah, I had to phone the police the other day, I got tongue-tied, trying to describe the people involved I hope everything's okay, but a good example, that's exactly right.

Speaker 2: 
19:24:42.440-19:24:49.720
I had to do the same thing recently, and I remember being like, oh, like it's just when you're, you know, witnessing something or when you're trying to recall things.

Speaker 2: 
19:24:49.920-19:24:51.120
it can be really tricky.

Speaker 2: 
19:24:51.440-19:24:54.160
So there's this example I always like to use.

Speaker 2: 
19:24:54.320-19:25:03.160
When I was in my undergrad degree, I remember one of the teachers got actually, no, we were all sitting in class.

Speaker 2: 
19:25:03.480-19:25:10.520
Actually, no, yes, it was in the it was in the undergraduate degree, and I was working on this project called the Bridge of Hope Innocence Initiative.

Speaker 2: 
19:25:10.740-19:25:27.719
just something I was doing and um I remember they this this guy we were sitting in class and we we saw um This guy came to the front of the classroom, he just opened the door and said, Hey, I was just wondering what where the bathrooms are.

Speaker 2: 
19:25:28.580-19:25:34.580
And I remember our manager was just like, oh, yep, they're down the hall to the left.

Speaker 2: 
19:25:34.900-19:25:45.920
So he left And about I think it was like forty five minutes to an hour later, our manager said, so that was totally a setup.

Speaker 2: 
19:25:46.160-19:25:51.220
I would like to know what you witnessed about the guy that came in before.

Speaker 2: 
19:25:51.460-19:25:54.420
So essentially, that was set up just to look at eyewitness testimony.

Speaker 2: 
19:25:54.660-19:25:56.980
So they basically said, what was he wearing?

Speaker 2: 
19:25:58.060-19:26:00.140
What were you know, what did he look like?

Speaker 2: 
19:26:00.300-19:26:01.260
What did he say?

Speaker 2: 
19:26:01.580-19:26:07.980
And I remember I was only able to recall that he was wearing a blazer and that because I liked I think I mean, I like blazers.

Speaker 2: 
19:26:07.340-19:26:09.100
And so I was like, oh, he was wearing a blazer.

Speaker 2: 
19:26:09.180-19:26:11.580
But that's really all I could remember.

Speaker 2: 
19:26:12.220-19:26:19.900
But interestingly, it shows how quickly our memory can dissipate, and when you're asked to recall questions in like a random heat of the moment.

Speaker 2: 
19:26:19.840-19:26:21.120
How that can be unreliable.

Speaker 2: 
19:26:21.360-19:26:24.240
But I remember I thought he was wearing white pants, he was wearing jeans.

Speaker 2: 
19:26:24.640-19:26:27.200
Someone else said he was wearing sneakers, he was wearing boots.

Speaker 2: 
19:26:27.440-19:26:28.480
So it's really interesting.

Speaker 2: 
19:26:28.720-19:26:29.920
Anyway, random side story.

Speaker 2: 
19:26:31.120-19:26:34.560
Lauren also said Amber Heard's sister being the only white yes, exactly.

Speaker 2: 
19:26:35.199-19:26:36.320
That's a really great example.

Speaker 2: 
19:26:36.560-19:26:46.940
Amber Heard's sister being the only eyewitness to Johnny Depp's abuse So then that could be attacked on the credibility the relationship between her and the plaintiff.

Speaker 2: 
19:26:47.260-19:26:53.659
So we've got a number of different reasons why direct evidence could be unreliable.

Speaker 2: 
19:26:53.640-19:26:56.120
So then you've also got circumstantial evidence, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:26:56.280-19:27:03.239
So circumstantial evidence could be DNA match, could be fingerprints, could be a phone tower data for example.

Speaker 2: 
19:27:03.480-19:27:05.640
So it's always a culmination of things.

Speaker 2: 
19:27:05.719-19:27:09.080
And again, it's like the puzzle pieces we need to put together.

Speaker 2: 
19:27:09.960-19:27:19.960
So the distinction in our textbook is noted as being fundamentally misconceived because I believe this quoted by Wells.

Speaker 2: 
19:27:20.040-19:27:24.120
And ultimately, all evidence requires inference and reasoning.

Speaker 2: 
19:27:24.280-19:27:32.600
So even direct evidence requires inferences about witness credibility, memory, accuracy as well as interpretation of events.

Speaker 2: 
19:27:33.140-19:27:52.440
So the primary difference or a practical difference is that circumstantial evidence requires more complex reasoning chains, like we spoke about before And this can create more opportunities for alternative explanations and challenges to what we call the logical connection, as we spoke about in our previous slide.

Speaker 2: 
19:27:53.900-19:27:56.300
Okay, so public house example.

Speaker 2: 
19:27:56.620-19:27:57.180
Alrighty.

Speaker 2: 
19:27:57.420-19:28:02.300
So again, you'll reading this in your textbooks this week.

Speaker 2: 
19:28:02.300-19:28:11.900
I kind of also like to create the content around the textbook because then it means that kind of two methods of learning and both textbooks.

Speaker 2: 
19:28:11.980-19:28:14.940
So I'll use both of them as well, but it'll just depend.

Speaker 2: 
19:28:15.020-19:28:16.300
I'll let you know depending.

Speaker 2: 
19:28:17.040-19:28:19.040
But they essentially cover similar things.

Speaker 2: 
19:28:19.199-19:28:21.760
It's just different ways of learning.

Speaker 2: 
19:28:22.080-19:28:26.560
But there's a famous example of circumstantial evidence in the reasoning from the Queen and Smith.

Speaker 2: 
19:28:26.800-19:28:29.199
This is from 1915.

Speaker 2: 
19:28:29.460-19:29:01.200
So, Justice Scrutton provided an explanation that appears pretty much in every evidence textbook So if you see a man going into a public house and you see him five minutes afterwards coming out, you can conclude that he's had a drink on circumstantial evidence You haven't seen him have a drink, but from the place he's gone to, the purpose for which the place is used, and his action when he comes out, you will be justified in inferring that he had a drink inside though you had not seen him.

Speaker 2: 
19:29:01.520-19:29:03.920
That is circumstantial evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:29:04.240-19:29:09.520
So ultimately, we break down circumstantial evidence into a few different categories.

Speaker 2: 
19:29:09.960-19:29:13.159
So first, it's based on human experience.

Speaker 2: 
19:29:13.480-19:29:15.400
So we know what public houses are for.

Speaker 2: 
19:29:15.480-19:29:19.960
So basically, like bars, whatnot, back in the day, that's what it was referred to.

Speaker 2: 
19:29:20.020-19:29:22.820
And how people will typically behave in a bar, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:29:23.140-19:29:24.980
So this knowledge comes from where?

Speaker 2: 
19:29:25.140-19:29:28.180
Living in society, not from special expertise, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:29:28.260-19:29:31.540
We could reasonably all infer, and this is a general question.

Speaker 2: 
19:29:31.619-19:29:33.780
About what goes on in a bar or club, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:29:33.860-19:29:35.139
Does everyone agree?

Speaker 4: 
19:29:38.020-19:29:38.579
Yeah, right.

Speaker 4: 
19:29:38.739-19:29:43.139
What do you think in a bar or what do you think people do in a bar or a club?

Speaker 4: 
19:29:46.300-19:29:53.659
They drink, they might dance, they might chat with everyone, they might not drink, they might, you know.

Speaker 4: 
19:29:54.580-19:29:55.460
Yeah, exactly right.

Speaker 4: 
19:29:55.540-19:29:57.780
So we have these differences, right?

Speaker 4: 
19:29:58.020-19:30:06.260
Now we already knew that before we all turned

Speaker 1: 
19:30:08.820-19:30:13.300
What do you think when you wait to a bar or a club?

Speaker 4: 
19:30:21.940-19:30:22.980
Oh, sorry.

Speaker 4: 
19:30:23.300-19:30:25.140
Okay, let's fix this.

Speaker 4: 
19:30:26.040-19:30:27.239
Oh no.

Speaker 4: 
19:30:27.560-19:30:27.960
Sorry.

Speaker 4: 
19:30:28.120-19:30:29.960
I'm not really sure what's happening.

Speaker 4: 
19:30:30.280-19:30:35.640
Can everyone Okay, how about that?

Speaker 2: 
19:30:37.620-19:30:38.260
How's that?

Speaker 2: 
19:30:38.420-19:30:39.300
Is that better?

Speaker 2: 
19:30:41.460-19:30:41.780
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
19:30:41.940-19:30:42.180
Sorry.

Speaker 2: 
19:30:42.260-19:30:42.740
I'm not really sure.

Speaker 2: 
19:30:42.900-19:30:43.780
Thank you for letting me know.

Speaker 2: 
19:30:43.940-19:30:47.600
I had a little red I didn't even realize that that was happening.

Speaker 2: 
19:30:47.760-19:30:49.920
So I appreciate you letting me know.

Speaker 2: 
19:30:50.160-19:30:52.320
Okay, so where did you did you hear me?

Speaker 2: 
19:30:52.400-19:30:54.240
Okay, I'll just repeat the question.

Speaker 2: 
19:30:54.960-19:30:56.720
And I'm so sorry about that.

Speaker 2: 
19:30:56.920-19:31:05.960
But do you think we could all reasonably infer what happened in a bar or a club before we were 18 or before we'd ever gone to a bar or a club?

Speaker 2: 
19:31:06.040-19:31:07.640
Do you think we could all reasonably infer that?

Speaker 2: 
19:31:07.800-19:31:07.960
Yeah.

Speaker 4: 
19:31:25.340-19:31:26.860
Yeah, well it depends exactly.

Speaker 4: 
19:31:26.940-19:31:27.340
That's right.

Speaker 4: 
19:31:27.420-19:31:30.700
So it depends on can you all hear me now again?

Speaker 2: 
19:31:32.240-19:31:33.120
Oh my goodness.

Speaker 2: 
19:31:33.200-19:31:34.240
I'm not really sure what's happening.

Speaker 2: 
19:31:34.320-19:31:34.960
I'm so sorry.

Speaker 2: 
19:31:35.120-19:31:38.160
This is oh, I'm so sorry.

Speaker 2: 
19:31:38.800-19:31:39.120
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
19:31:39.360-19:31:41.760
I'm not really sure what happened because I feel like it was okay.

Speaker 2: 
19:31:41.920-19:31:42.720
Now it's not okay.

Speaker 2: 
19:31:42.960-19:31:43.280
All right.

Speaker 2: 
19:31:43.360-19:31:44.480
Can you hear me again?

Speaker 2: 
19:31:47.780-19:31:48.500
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
19:31:48.820-19:31:49.300
All right.

Speaker 2: 
19:31:49.619-19:31:53.640
So we have some different um Comments here.

Speaker 2: 
19:31:53.720-19:31:55.720
So, yeah, it can depend on your cultural background, that's right.

Speaker 2: 
19:31:55.800-19:32:02.120
So, what you're exposed to, what you're told, what you learn through tacit learning, through just everyday society, from school.

Speaker 2: 
19:32:02.840-19:32:07.400
You've also got, yeah, parents taking us, talking to us.

Speaker 2: 
19:32:07.680-19:32:10.240
You've got TV shows, movies, like pop culture.

Speaker 2: 
19:32:10.400-19:32:11.840
That's exactly right.

Speaker 2: 
19:32:12.160-19:32:17.520
So we learn this through just living in society, not just through special expertise.

Speaker 2: 
19:32:17.680-19:32:21.040
And we will, of course, learn about expert witnesses.

Speaker 2: 
19:32:20.940-19:32:24.940
throughout this unit as well and what that actually means.

Speaker 2: 
19:32:25.260-19:32:33.180
Another thing to note, that also comes up a lot in assessments slash exams, so witnesses and credibility, just FYI.

Speaker 2: 
19:32:33.760-19:32:37.760
So, secondly, it also involves logical inference.

Speaker 2: 
19:32:38.080-19:32:40.320
So, we reason from observable facts.

Speaker 2: 
19:32:40.640-19:32:46.960
So, entering, exiting, the time spent inside, so the time that person might have spent inside a bar or a club.

Speaker 2: 
19:32:47.760-19:32:53.599
And we reason from observable observable facts to conclusions about unobserved facts.

Speaker 2: 
19:32:53.840-19:33:01.199
Now what that means is we didn't actually see that any drinking occurred, but we're trying we can kind of infer, well, you went into a bar.

Speaker 2: 
19:33:01.240-19:33:04.680
You came out five minutes later, you might have had a drink.

Speaker 2: 
19:33:05.000-19:33:07.080
There might be another way that you could do that though.

Speaker 2: 
19:33:07.240-19:33:13.780
So, for example, if you saw the person go into a bar and they come out five minutes later stumbling, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:33:14.100-19:33:21.140
You would use what you've seen or otherwise perceived to draw that inference that that person may have been drinking as well.

Speaker 2: 
19:33:21.760-19:33:23.920
Thirdly, though, it's not certainty.

Speaker 2: 
19:33:24.160-19:33:35.600
So this was also acknowledged by Justice Scrutton, who said even in England of nineteen fifteen, a person may have entered and remained in a public house for five minutes without having had a drink.

Speaker 2: 
19:33:35.840-19:33:37.360
Maybe they used the bathroom.

Speaker 2: 
19:33:37.680-19:33:38.960
Maybe they asked for directions.

Speaker 2: 
19:33:39.200-19:33:41.360
Or maybe they met someone briefly.

Speaker 2: 
19:33:41.680-19:33:46.160
So there's also ways that that can be disproven.

Speaker 2: 
19:33:47.060-19:33:48.340
Also, the person's history.

Speaker 2: 
19:33:48.420-19:33:48.740
That's right.

Speaker 2: 
19:33:48.820-19:33:51.780
If they go exactly right, Hannah, that's a great point.

Speaker 2: 
19:33:52.020-19:33:56.980
So even if a person I'm so Hannah's noted, just for everyone listening on the recording.

Speaker 2: 
19:33:57.020-19:33:58.540
Also, the person's history.

Speaker 2: 
19:33:58.860-19:34:02.060
If they go to a pub every Thursday, payday and have a drink, that's right.

Speaker 2: 
19:34:02.220-19:34:10.460
So, for example, if there has been a crime committed, you're wanting to collect evidence of that temporal coincidence, the fact that they're always there every Thursday.

Speaker 2: 
19:34:10.640-19:34:19.040
you might be able to have different testimony receipts, just to show that this is something that happens, right, every Thursday.

Speaker 2: 
19:34:19.560-19:34:27.160
So thirdly, we look at sorry, fourthly, we look at how we reason it shows how we reason daily.

Speaker 2: 
19:34:27.320-19:34:32.640
So circumstantial reasoning isn't outlandish legal reasoning, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:34:32.800-19:34:33.680
We use it every day.

Speaker 2: 
19:34:33.920-19:34:35.920
We use it consistently every day in real life.

Speaker 2: 
19:34:36.240-19:34:39.440
We draw inferences all the time, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:34:39.520-19:34:45.100
So say for example, you're at work and your mate who consistently comes in Late, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:34:45.659-19:34:48.219
For example, your colleague comes in late every day.

Speaker 2: 
19:34:48.540-19:34:50.140
And then one day they're really early.

Speaker 2: 
19:34:50.460-19:35:02.480
You might draw an inference and be like, oh, like maybe they got a lift into work because they always complain about public transport because it is an actual nightmare sometimes that maybe they got a lift in, that's why they're early.

Speaker 2: 
19:35:02.560-19:35:05.840
You might draw that inference without actually even asking.

Speaker 2: 
19:35:05.360-19:35:05.520
Them.

Speaker 2: 
19:35:05.680-19:35:05.840
Yeah.

Speaker 2: 
19:35:06.480-19:35:12.400
So this example is used to demonstrate why circumstantial evidence can be really powerful.

Speaker 2: 
19:35:12.720-19:35:30.040
So while we can't be certain, and if we're using the example in Smith, while we can't be certain that the drinking actually occurred, the inference might be strong enough that most reasonable people would accept it accept it as absent contrary evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:35:30.200-19:35:33.320
Okay, so it would just be accepted on the face.

Speaker 2: 
19:35:34.280-19:35:47.780
But I guess the key the key message is that multiple pieces of circumstantial evidence can combine to create very strong cases overall.

Speaker 2: 
19:35:47.719-19:36:03.739
And this occurs even when individual pieces allow for alternative explanations, because what we're doing is we're using human log we're using logical inference, we're using the fact that it might not be completely certain, and we're using our everyday reasoning.

Speaker 2: 
19:36:03.980-19:36:05.340
Does this make sense?

Speaker 2: 
19:36:10.520-19:36:11.480
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
19:36:12.120-19:36:14.040
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

Speaker 2: 
19:36:15.460-19:36:21.060
Okay, so you will become familiar with the Queen and Ryan framework.

Speaker 2: 
19:36:21.219-19:36:27.460
I'm just going to talk about it pretty briefly briefly meaning a little bit extensively, but kind of briefly.

Speaker 2: 
19:36:27.780-19:36:32.740
But it's a it's kind of like a legal theory to practice.

Speaker 2: 
19:36:33.840-19:36:42.320
Essentially, courts were used to determine or use this framework to determine when inferences can be drawn from circumstantial evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:36:42.020-19:36:45.780
And it's just important to know, and I think it's really interesting.

Speaker 2: 
19:36:46.660-19:36:51.300
But this case, the case of the Queen and Ryan.

Speaker 2: 
19:36:52.960-19:37:00.560
was actually from a New South Wales Court of Appeal, or the Criminal Court of Appeal, probably specify this.

Speaker 2: 
19:37:01.040-19:37:02.720
Sorry, one second.

Speaker 2: 
19:37:03.080-19:37:09.640
Just going to make sure that everyone I was just going to make sure that you all had access to the Barnett Jade version.

Speaker 2: 
19:37:09.800-19:37:25.880
Yes, so you can find this case online as well as in the textbo But ultimately, in this case, the Criminal Court of Appeal in New South Wales involved whether a jury could infer lack of consent from evidence Of the complainant's distress.

Speaker 2: 
19:37:25.960-19:37:36.380
So basically, we're looking at whether or not the complainant's distress Was able to prove that there was a lack of consent in that case.

Speaker 2: 
19:37:36.540-19:37:42.300
And it was, you know, obviously, once you read the case, it makes a lot of sense.

Speaker 2: 
19:37:42.460-19:37:44.860
But I think we're just going to look at the framework today.

Speaker 2: 
19:37:45.119-19:37:45.920
All right.

Speaker 2: 
19:37:46.239-19:37:54.079
So in this particular framework, and the reason why I think it's just good to keep this in mind is when you actually do read the case, you'll see what I mean.

Speaker 2: 
19:37:54.560-19:38:01.360
But there was a systemic two-step framework that courts will actually still use today.

Speaker 2: 
19:38:01.840-19:38:04.640
So we look at whether an inference is actually possible.

Speaker 2: 
19:38:04.880-19:38:20.820
So it requires showing that a human experience can demonstrate a sufficient pattern of conjunction between evidence as well as the conclusion So we basically need to show that when fact A exists, fact X regularly occurs as well.

Speaker 2: 
19:38:21.059-19:38:24.179
Now it doesn't make much sense when you say it like that.

Speaker 2: 
19:38:24.140-19:38:28.460
But ultimately, we are trying to prove this sort of causal nexus.

Speaker 2: 
19:38:28.699-19:38:35.140
Okay, we need to prove that there's a conjunction, like it says here, between this fact And this fact.

Speaker 2: 
19:38:35.300-19:38:36.820
So complainants, distress.

Speaker 2: 
19:38:36.980-19:38:38.900
So we've got complainants to stress.

Speaker 2: 
19:38:39.220-19:38:40.420
And then lack of consent.

Speaker 2: 
19:38:40.740-19:38:44.980
Okay, so whether it's a regular pattern or not a coincidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:38:44.840-19:38:51.800
So in this particular case, even if an inference is drawn, we need to consider whether it's appropriate in the specific circumstances.

Speaker 2: 
19:38:52.120-19:38:56.520
But we also need to look at taking into account alternative explanations.

Speaker 2: 
19:38:57.840-19:39:11.440
Justice Mahoney said in that particular case, it is possible to draw the inference that X did exist if human experience has shown that in a sufficient number of cases where A has been found to exist, X will exist.

Speaker 2: 
19:39:11.240-19:39:13.400
As well, or X will be said to exist.

Speaker 2: 
19:39:13.640-19:39:18.600
So ultimately, we're trying to, I guess, prove that causal nexus.

Speaker 2: 
19:39:18.920-19:39:40.380
So in this case, regarding the distress It was said that the fact that a lady of the relevant age and circumstances was distressed may be capable of supporting an inference that she was sexually assaulted if human experience has shown there is sufficiently regularly the conjunction of distress and sexual assault.

Speaker 2: 
19:39:40.700-19:39:48.780
Now do we see how we're trying to prove that nexus between the two feelings and between the two pieces of evidence?

Speaker 2: 
19:39:56.900-19:39:58.020
Yes, absolutely.

Speaker 2: 
19:39:58.100-19:40:00.739
So it's like common sense, right, exactly.

Speaker 2: 
19:40:01.560-19:40:04.600
So I would say that behavioral evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:40:04.680-19:40:19.219
So when we're looking at, again, another concept of evidence, because we'll also go into tendency evidence coincidence evidence, two very important areas of evidence law, we will look at what that actually means as well.

Speaker 2: 
19:40:19.540-19:40:29.280
So whether there's a tendency or propensity to complete compete that sorry, to up perpetrate, commit the same offence.

Speaker 2: 
19:40:29.440-19:40:31.360
So for example, an arson case.

Speaker 2: 
19:40:31.680-19:40:34.080
And then we've got coincidence evidence, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:40:34.160-19:40:37.680
So it just keeps, I guess, literally in its name coincidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:40:39.520-19:40:43.440
So we've got, okay, what just so we've got what distress look like.

Speaker 2: 
19:40:43.600-19:40:44.960
So what does distress look like?

Speaker 2: 
19:40:45.280-19:40:46.000
And that's the thing.

Speaker 2: 
19:40:46.160-19:40:50.960
We might, when we're looking at distress, what we could do is if we were establishing this in a court.

Speaker 2: 
19:40:51.300-19:40:53.219
what we would do.

Speaker 2: 
19:40:54.659-19:40:56.179
Lauren, that's really funny.

Speaker 2: 
19:40:57.140-19:40:58.179
So hopefully not.

Speaker 2: 
19:40:58.260-19:41:00.820
Hopefully I'll prepare you all well enough that you don't feel distressed.

Speaker 2: 
19:41:01.900-19:41:17.680
But what we would do is, if we're in a court, we might call an expert, we might call a psychologist to outline what distress may look like in survivors of sexual assault And they might be able to corroborate what that might actually look like.

Speaker 2: 
19:41:18.160-19:41:20.800
Russell study of A, while C possibly D.

Speaker 2: 
19:41:20.960-19:41:22.320
Yeah, 100%.

Speaker 2: 
19:41:23.280-19:41:24.240
So exactly right.

Speaker 2: 
19:41:24.480-19:41:27.200
So we just need to find that nexus.

Speaker 2: 
19:41:27.980-19:41:38.300
Now what's important though as well is Mahoney in that case did note that human conduct is more variable.

Speaker 2: 
19:41:39.260-19:41:44.219
So distress is obviously going to look different depending on different people.

Speaker 2: 
19:41:44.540-19:41:45.179
Oh, sorry.

Speaker 2: 
19:41:45.340-19:41:45.659
I know.

Speaker 2: 
19:41:45.820-19:41:48.139
He's literally stalking me.

Speaker 2: 
19:41:49.099-19:41:50.780
One of them is stalking me.

Speaker 2: 
19:41:50.560-19:41:52.719
I'm really sorry about my dog.

Speaker 2: 
19:41:54.000-19:41:55.920
Yeah, this might happen a lot too.

Speaker 2: 
19:41:56.640-19:41:57.520
They will bark.

Speaker 2: 
19:41:57.840-19:42:00.640
They are sausage dogs and they might be gentle.

Speaker 2: 
19:42:00.840-19:42:02.280
breeze and they will bark at it.

Speaker 2: 
19:42:02.360-19:42:05.880
So I apologize I apologize about that.

Speaker 2: 
19:42:06.200-19:42:10.200
So you know, maybe they're all chatting amongst themselves now.

Speaker 2: 
19:42:12.200-19:42:21.580
So Basically, that's why behavioral evidence can be more challenging than physical evidence, because people react differently to similar situations, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:42:21.900-19:42:25.580
And similar reactions can have multiple causes.

Speaker 2: 
19:42:25.619-19:42:27.860
So just keep that in mind.

Speaker 2: 
19:42:28.179-19:42:29.540
Oh gosh, I'm so sorry.

Speaker 2: 
19:42:29.699-19:42:34.500
Well, if you'd like to find mine, please come and get him because seriously he's driving me insane.

Speaker 2: 
19:42:34.739-19:42:37.699
So if you'd like, kindly direct your dog to come look for my dog.

Speaker 2: 
19:42:37.780-19:42:39.059
That would be awesome.

Speaker 2: 
19:42:40.800-19:42:54.219
Okay, so in terms of possibility, I'm just going to kind of go through this a bit quicker because I feel like it is important, but we don't necessarily have to like cover it in substantial detail.

Speaker 2: 
19:42:54.380-19:42:57.420
But it's just good to have in the slides in case you want to refer to it.

Speaker 2: 
19:42:58.619-19:43:12.380
Elaborating on step one, this is establishing that an inference is possible based on human experience, like we spoke about in our previous example of seeing a guy come out of a bar and inferring that he's had a drink.

Speaker 2: 
19:43:12.619-19:43:33.760
So the test in that case is that it's possible to draw an inference if human experience has shown in a number of sufficient cases that it's been found to ex So if we apply this to distress, like in this particular case, does human experience, for example, show that sexual assault victims regularly display distress?

Speaker 2: 
19:43:34.000-19:43:34.560
What do you think?

Speaker 2: 
19:43:34.640-19:43:36.320
Or victims of assault?

Speaker 2: 
19:43:39.140-19:43:40.179
Yes, right.

Speaker 2: 
19:43:40.420-19:43:47.140
So if yes, then do you think it's possible to infer sexual assault from distress evidence or if someone was experiencing distress?

Speaker 2: 
19:43:47.219-19:43:48.420
Do you think we could?

Speaker 2: 
19:43:49.980-19:43:53.660
Say the fact pattern indicates that a person has been sexually assaulted.

Speaker 2: 
19:43:53.980-19:43:55.660
Could we infer that from their distress?

Speaker 2: 
19:43:55.820-19:43:56.540
Yeah, we could.

Speaker 2: 
19:43:56.860-19:43:57.420
Right?

Speaker 2: 
19:43:57.820-19:44:03.820
But we just need to keep in mind that human behavior is more variable than a physical phenomenon, okay?

Speaker 2: 
19:44:03.980-19:44:09.640
So that does create two different challenges here So we know that not everyone reacts the same way.

Speaker 2: 
19:44:09.960-19:44:16.040
So some sexual assault victim survivors might not show distress due to shock trauma responses.

Speaker 2: 
19:44:16.280-19:44:21.000
Exactly, exactly what yes, what Russell said, Junko said.

Speaker 2: 
19:44:21.600-19:44:28.800
and trauma responses, cultural factors, coping mechanisms, but it doesn't invalidate the general pattern.

Speaker 2: 
19:44:29.120-19:44:32.620
It does show the inference though, isn't universal.

Speaker 2: 
19:44:32.940-19:44:34.460
And we see this all the time, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:44:34.620-19:44:47.159
How many times have you seen on T V where a person has been charged and they're not showing any emotion whatsoever.

Speaker 2: 
19:44:47.480-19:44:50.679
And that emotion doesn't necessarily mean that person's guilty, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:44:50.760-19:44:52.679
We all act react differently.

Speaker 2: 
19:44:53.700-19:44:56.660
And Lauren said hysterical versus shut down and withdrawn.

Speaker 2: 
19:44:56.820-19:44:57.300
Exactly right.

Speaker 2: 
19:44:57.620-19:45:03.060
So one person might behave completely differently and one person might withdraw.

Speaker 2: 
19:45:04.040-19:45:07.239
And then Mason said a witness witness goes into a detail.

Speaker 2: 
19:45:07.480-19:45:10.760
Yes, so we all have to read that whole because it does sound amazing.

Speaker 2: 
19:45:11.719-19:45:14.679
And Judith said, it's a very difficult area.

Speaker 2: 
19:45:14.540-19:45:17.099
As the opposite should not be inferred that it didn't take place.

Speaker 2: 
19:45:17.260-19:45:18.540
And that's exactly right.

Speaker 2: 
19:45:18.860-19:45:19.820
That's exactly right.

Speaker 2: 
19:45:20.139-19:45:23.340
So we have to be really careful when we do make those inferences.

Speaker 2: 
19:45:23.579-19:45:28.059
And it doesn't mean that so an inference isn't universal.

Speaker 2: 
19:45:28.060-19:45:33.020
The other challenge is that multiple causes can be for the same behaviour.

Speaker 2: 
19:45:33.580-19:45:36.140
So distress could result from a sexual assault.

Speaker 2: 
19:45:36.219-19:45:41.200
It could also result from a physical assault Embarrassment, fear, medical issues, or unrelated personal problems.

Speaker 2: 
19:45:41.280-19:45:44.720
So it might not even have to like be it might not be that general inference, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:45:44.800-19:45:51.260
So we can't necessarily draw that But what we're doing is we're not looking for perfect correlations.

Speaker 2: 
19:45:51.500-19:45:52.540
We're looking for patterns.

Speaker 2: 
19:45:52.780-19:45:57.260
We need to look for patterns that are strong enough to support reasonable inferences.

Speaker 2: 
19:45:57.440-19:46:10.559
So the question here, and this is what it's really important to keep in mind when you come to your assignments, exams, in legal practice, in practice in general.

Speaker 2: 
19:46:11.080-19:46:30.780
that the question isn't do all X or all of the evidence lead to what's being purported, but rather, does the evidence lead to what is being reported enough or often enough that a reasonable person could consider a connection.

Speaker 2: 
19:46:31.100-19:46:54.219
So that's why it's really important that we have judges, and that's why it's important we have judicial experience because Common sense is really, you know, I guess comes into play because judges need to assess where the proposed inferences are going to reflect genuine patterns of human experiences or unfounded assumptions and stereotypes, and that way they can guide the jury and give those directions.

Speaker 2: 
19:46:53.720-19:46:58.920
So if you're looking for circumstantial reasoning and looking for that framework, have a look at Ryan.

Speaker 2: 
19:46:59.240-19:47:01.080
I will just quickly run through.

Speaker 2: 
19:47:02.040-19:47:04.841
the competing explanations as well.

Speaker 2: 
19:47:05.160-19:47:13.560
But in step two of Ryan, it was asked whether inference should be drawn in particular circumstances of the case.

Speaker 2: 
19:47:14.139-19:47:24.080
But I guess it's like I guess it's a difficult thing to say because in Ryan in Ryan, the case itself, when you do read it And you'll think back to what we spoke about here.

Speaker 2: 
19:47:24.399-19:47:39.219
There were several alternative explanations for the complainant's distress in that particular case So there could have been a physical assault according to the evidence that definitely occurred, embarrassment, like I spoke about before, fear, humiliation, general trauma of the incident.

Speaker 2: 
19:47:38.820-19:47:49.059
So, I guess the point that the justice was trying to make was that the mere existence of other possible causes of distress does not negate, without more, the possibility of such an inference.

Speaker 2: 
19:47:49.139-19:47:51.940
It basically doesn't negate that it could have actually occurred.

Speaker 2: 
19:47:51.740-19:48:01.420
So the test is whether considering all the circumstances, sexual assault emerges as sufficiently more likely to be the cause of the distress Okay.

Speaker 2: 
19:48:01.740-19:48:07.500
So when they're looking at these cases, there's a careful analysis of things like timing.

Speaker 2: 
19:48:07.819-19:48:10.859
So how close in time was the distress to the incident?

Speaker 2: 
19:48:11.099-19:48:11.899
The context.

Speaker 2: 
19:48:12.139-19:48:12.939
What was the setting?

Speaker 2: 
19:48:13.179-19:48:14.780
What was the nature of the distress?

Speaker 2: 
19:48:15.240-19:48:17.800
Are there any alternative explanations?

Speaker 2: 
19:48:18.120-19:48:19.800
And also the cumulative evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:48:19.960-19:48:28.580
Now, the reason why this is relevant is because you're going to have to consider all of these things when you're looking at these cases Okay.

Speaker 2: 
19:48:29.460-19:48:35.380
When you're looking at circumstantial evidence, timing, contest, top, costary, context, nature.

Speaker 2: 
19:48:35.939-19:48:37.300
alternative explanations.

Speaker 2: 
19:48:37.540-19:48:38.979
There are things that you'll need to address.

Speaker 2: 
19:48:39.139-19:48:50.640
Remember, we're always thinking about any time you think of an argument, think about how it can be counteracted or counterargued I feel like that's the most important thing to do because you always be one step ahead.

Speaker 2: 
19:48:50.719-19:48:51.840
Sometimes you might not be.

Speaker 2: 
19:48:52.000-19:48:54.880
I guess if you're thinking about it, you already are.

Speaker 2: 
19:48:55.979-19:49:05.019
So ultimately, this framework is important because it protects against two dangers, so to speak.

Speaker 2: 
19:49:04.860-19:49:17.900
So first, it excludes legitimate inferences because perfect certainty about all of the evidence purporting to be something is completely impossible, as we've learned tonight.

Speaker 2: 
19:49:17.940-19:49:22.340
Second, allowing speculation based on insufficient foundation.

Speaker 2: 
19:49:22.580-19:49:26.580
So we can't speculate where we'd have insufficient evidence.

Speaker 2: 
19:49:26.900-19:49:28.260
So ultimately.

Speaker 2: 
19:49:28.820-19:49:30.500
We just need to strike a balance.

Speaker 2: 
19:49:30.740-19:49:37.300
So like the Justice said, it's about the most likely standard, okay?

Speaker 2: 
19:49:37.460-19:49:40.420
So possibility doesn't demand absolute certainty.

Speaker 2: 
19:49:40.660-19:49:40.820
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
19:49:41.300-19:49:44.320
Does that make sense Is everyone still with me?

Speaker 2: 
19:49:48.480-19:49:48.960
Sweet.

Speaker 2: 
19:49:49.120-19:49:50.721
Okay, perfect, perfect.

Speaker 2: 
19:49:52.340-19:49:52.980
All right.

Speaker 2: 
19:49:53.141-19:49:56.980
So we're just going to go over speculation and inference again.

Speaker 2: 
19:49:57.300-19:50:07.680
So it's we're sort of all building to some different cases that we'll speak about as well So, the Ryan framework is very important.

Speaker 2: 
19:50:09.119-19:50:11.359
The reason why it's so important, I guess.

Speaker 2: 
19:50:11.641-19:50:16.280
We're going to address it again throughout the teaching period, just to get you thinking.

Speaker 2: 
19:50:16.601-19:50:20.841
But it helps us distinguish legitimate inference from improper speculation.

Speaker 2: 
19:50:21.080-19:50:28.200
I think that's the key takeaway here So think about it like distinguishing legitimate inference from improper speculation.

Speaker 2: 
19:50:28.520-19:50:30.440
What do you think that means?

Speaker 2: 
19:50:35.399-19:50:37.000
Like on the face of things.

Speaker 2: 
19:50:52.381-19:50:54.221
Yep, considering bias.

Speaker 2: 
19:50:54.460-19:50:56.301
So yep, that's a great example.

Speaker 2: 
19:50:56.620-19:50:59.420
So we're not speculating, essentially.

Speaker 2: 
19:50:59.580-19:51:14.319
We're trying to make sure that we have a legitimate reason to draw inferences Now, that being said, the case of prima facie facts, yep, that's exactly right.

Speaker 2: 
19:51:14.479-19:51:18.560
So we've got things that we've, I mean, we've got facts on the surface.

Speaker 2: 
19:51:18.721-19:51:22.641
And we need to make sure that we're using what we have and not just speculating.

Speaker 2: 
19:51:22.721-19:51:36.100
And this is, I guess, another important thing because Remember when we do evidence exams, sorry, when we do law exams, for example, one of the key takeaways is never make up facts.

Speaker 2: 
19:51:36.340-19:51:37.700
We go with what we've got.

Speaker 2: 
19:51:37.940-19:51:45.720
If it's not there, there's probably a reason So an example of improper speculation, the case of the Queen and Whores.

Speaker 2: 
19:51:46.040-19:51:56.480
So in that particular case, the defendant claimed self defense And they argued that the victim was under the influence of heroin at the time of a stabbing.

Speaker 2: 
19:51:57.700-19:52:12.560
To support this, the defendant offered evidence that twelve days after the stabbing, the victim had a craving for narcotics Now why do you think that was deemed to be mere speculation rather than influence?

Speaker 2: 
19:52:12.720-19:52:14.640
Why do you think that was the case?

Speaker 2: 
19:52:14.360-19:52:18.681
So they said that, okay, they were under the influence of heroin.

Speaker 2: 
19:52:19.000-19:52:22.280
And then they said twelve days after stabbing, they had a craving for narcotics.

Speaker 2: 
19:52:22.440-19:52:26.360
Why do you think that, that's kind of more speculative?

Speaker 2: 
19:52:38.480-19:52:38.800
Yep.

Speaker 2: 
19:52:39.600-19:52:42.480
Yep, so there's no evidence at the time to suggest use.

Speaker 2: 
19:52:42.800-19:52:43.920
Excellent, excellent.

Speaker 2: 
19:52:44.080-19:52:46.880
So there's a gap between addiction and current intoxication.

Speaker 2: 
19:52:46.960-19:52:49.440
That could be a too much of a large gap.

Speaker 2: 
19:52:49.340-19:52:52.619
There might not be that substantive evidence to support it.

Speaker 2: 
19:52:53.500-19:52:57.500
Yes, so ultimately, it's an addictive substance, so an assumption has been made.

Speaker 2: 
19:52:57.659-19:53:00.100
100% Well done, all over it.

Speaker 2: 
19:53:00.420-19:53:06.580
So there was no foundation for concluding that being addicted means being under the influence at any particular time.

Speaker 2: 
19:53:06.740-19:53:10.100
So just because you're addicted to something doesn't mean you're always under the influence, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:53:10.620-19:53:18.140
So in this case, it was a bit of a gap between the addiction and current intoxication, and it was too large to bridge with reasonable inference.

Speaker 2: 
19:53:18.300-19:53:19.340
Do you agree?

Speaker 2: 
19:53:26.560-19:53:27.200
Excellent.

Speaker 5: 
19:53:27.280-19:53:27.520
Yes.

Speaker 2: 
19:53:27.680-19:53:28.720
Yes, that's one hundred percent.

Speaker 2: 
19:53:28.800-19:53:29.520
I agree too.

Speaker 2: 
19:53:29.840-19:53:34.601
I think it would have been like too large of a temporal Time frame.

Speaker 2: 
19:53:35.801-19:53:39.400
So then we've also got Clay and the Queen, so or the bed wedding case.

Speaker 2: 
19:53:39.480-19:53:49.940
And I think that it's good to, when you're learning about these cases, to kind of put some key words, I guess, to these cases.

Speaker 2: 
19:53:50.181-19:53:58.181
If you've had me before in another class, you know I always suggest this, just so you can draw on these cases pretty quickly.

Speaker 2: 
19:53:58.460-19:54:10.381
So this case particularly showed a lack of proper foundation, how a lack of proper foundation can turn relevant evidence or potentially relevant evidence into improper speculation.

Speaker 2: 
19:54:10.420-19:54:17.540
So this case had to do with three child sexual abuse complainants who had all experienced bedwetting.

Speaker 2: 
19:54:17.779-19:54:33.760
So the Crown in this case offered this particular fact or that fact as supporting evidence without calling expert testimony or expert witnesses about the connections between abuse and bedwedding So we spoke about expert witnesses before.

Speaker 2: 
19:54:34.080-19:54:36.560
And why do you think that this was so important to do?

Speaker 2: 
19:54:36.640-19:54:43.760
Why do you think that that was a detriment in adducing this evidence without proper basis or without having someone corroborate that.

Speaker 3: 
19:54:44.240-19:54:50.681
We could explain the evidence or explain like basically provided an opinion that was expert in that field.

Speaker 3: 
19:54:50.841-19:54:59.000
Like they knew they were a pediatrician or a psychiatrist or psychologist, they could give evidence that could be tested.

Speaker 2: 
19:54:59.640-19:55:02.600
Excellent, excellent, that's right, exactly right.

Speaker 2: 
19:55:02.920-19:55:08.920
Because no evid like because the jury were left at large to essentially speculate.

Speaker 2: 
19:55:08.641-19:55:18.960
Upon how important this piece of evidence could be because they didn't have someone there, well, then have an expert like a psychologist or like a psychiatrist to explain what the correlation is.

Speaker 2: 
19:55:19.860-19:55:25.140
So ultimately, that evidence could be irrelevant or was irrelevant because they couldn't substantiate it.

Speaker 2: 
19:55:25.220-19:55:25.860
So that's excellent.

Speaker 2: 
19:55:26.020-19:55:29.920
Thank And Lauren's also commented, explaining the relevance of behavior.

Speaker 2: 
19:55:30.080-19:55:30.721
That's exactly right.

Speaker 2: 
19:55:30.960-19:55:32.480
So and Graeme said that too.

Speaker 2: 
19:55:32.641-19:55:34.080
So explaining that correlation.

Speaker 2: 
19:55:34.320-19:55:37.681
So well done, Russell, Lauren and Graham.

Speaker 2: 
19:55:37.761-19:55:38.881
So exactly right.

Speaker 2: 
19:55:39.021-19:55:41.740
We need that correlation, we need that substantiation.

Speaker 2: 
19:55:42.061-19:55:46.700
So the problem wasn't that bedwetting can never be relevant to abuse cases.

Speaker 2: 
19:55:47.021-19:55:48.620
Don't apologize at all.

Speaker 2: 
19:55:48.620-19:55:50.060
Do not apologize at all.

Speaker 2: 
19:55:51.260-19:55:55.899
I feel like sometimes there's also a lag on the chat, so I'm sorry if I don't get to anyone's comments.

Speaker 2: 
19:55:56.140-19:55:57.580
I think there sometimes can be.

Speaker 2: 
19:55:59.100-19:56:07.160
So just I will read them though, of course So I think the problem in this case was it wasn't that bedwetting can never be relevant to abuse cases.

Speaker 2: 
19:56:07.240-19:56:08.521
That's not what we're saying.

Speaker 2: 
19:56:08.760-19:56:14.300
But with proper expert witnesses or establishing a proper expert foundation It could be.

Speaker 2: 
19:56:14.540-19:56:23.180
So the problem was asking the jury to speculate about medical and psychological connections without any evidence to establish these connections.

Speaker 2: 
19:56:23.340-19:56:24.700
Now, this is really important, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:56:24.940-19:56:30.819
So in your exams or in your assignments How are you going to substantiate what you're saying?

Speaker 2: 
19:56:31.140-19:56:33.540
That's a really, really fundamental question.

Speaker 2: 
19:56:33.859-19:56:35.939
So we can't just say there's a correlation.

Speaker 2: 
19:56:36.180-19:56:37.859
How would we prove that there's a correlation?

Speaker 2: 
19:56:38.100-19:56:47.700
If you're writing submissions, what could you tell your member of council, for example, to what could you tell them to rely on?

Speaker 2: 
19:56:47.940-19:56:48.900
Or how you could prove it?

Speaker 2: 
19:56:48.980-19:56:51.540
Or is there a precedent that you could use to prove it, for example?

Speaker 2: 
19:56:51.860-19:56:54.660
We want to know how we can substantiate things.

Speaker 2: 
19:56:55.240-19:56:58.280
So, keep that in mind as well.

Speaker 2: 
19:56:58.601-19:57:01.080
So, I would say there's a key distinction.

Speaker 2: 
19:57:01.400-19:57:10.820
So, there's legitimate inferences, and these legitimate inferences are generally based on patterns of human experience, and we've spoken about that quite a bit this evening.

Speaker 2: 
19:57:11.141-19:57:17.460
And this is supported by evidence or common knowledge, and this will come up quite a bit throughout our teaching period.

Speaker 2: 
19:57:17.420-19:57:24.220
So we've also got our improper speculation, again, based on assumptions, stereotypes or connections.

Speaker 2: 
19:57:24.540-19:57:28.060
And this is not established by evidence or experience as well.

Speaker 2: 
19:57:28.380-19:57:28.699
Okay?

Speaker 2: 
19:57:29.521-19:57:30.800
So think about those two things.

Speaker 2: 
19:57:30.960-19:57:37.360
We've got to draw key distinctions between what is a legitimate inference that can be drawn and what is speculation.

Speaker 2: 
19:57:37.681-19:57:40.160
So how do we avoid speculation, right?

Speaker 2: 
19:57:40.320-19:57:49.239
And if you get a question like this in your exam or If it comes up along the line, you need to establish the foundation for those proposed inferences.

Speaker 2: 
19:57:49.479-19:57:56.680
We need that through evidence or we need to look to the judge or letting the judge know that, that's what we're doing.

Speaker 2: 
19:57:57.239-19:58:03.560
We need to consider whether there's a connection that relies on specialized knowledge, which may require expert testimony.

Speaker 2: 
19:58:03.720-19:58:11.000
Now that's something, again, we will talk about when we talk about witnesses down the track and expert witnesses and why we would use them.

Speaker 2: 
19:58:12.140-19:58:21.300
For example, you might get a comment about I mean a comment, a question on your exam about I guess, bank transactions.

Speaker 2: 
19:58:21.540-19:58:29.460
Okay, for example, there might be something, a documentary piece of evidence that a company wants to put in some bank transactions.

Speaker 2: 
19:58:29.780-19:58:36.900
Now to a layperson actions or potentially criminal transactions in there.

Speaker 2: 
19:58:37.060-19:58:50.200
To a lay person, you might not be able to understand on the face of what they mean, but you might get a frenzy accountant to come in and become an expert wit But there's a certain criteria, a very, very special criteria there as well.

Speaker 2: 
19:58:50.440-19:58:58.540
So we'll learn about that We also need to assess whether reasonable people based on common experience would accept that logical connection.

Speaker 2: 
19:58:58.860-19:59:05.500
And we also need to be wary of inferences that depend on controversial assumptions of human behavior.

Speaker 2: 
19:59:05.660-19:59:09.060
Okay, so Keep that in mind as well.

Speaker 2: 
19:59:09.700-19:59:11.860
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
19:59:12.500-19:59:13.140
All righty.

Speaker 2: 
19:59:13.940-19:59:15.380
Too much time left.

Speaker 2: 
19:59:15.700-19:59:18.340
So hopefully everyone's still with me.

Speaker 2: 
19:59:18.659-19:59:22.100
But we'll have a bit of a look at a couple of different cases now.

Speaker 2: 
19:59:22.420-19:59:24.180
I mentioned Smith and the Queen earlier.

Speaker 2: 
19:59:24.260-19:59:26.260
There were two Smith cases.

Speaker 2: 
19:59:26.580-19:59:28.100
This is the first one I mentioned.

Speaker 2: 
19:59:28.420-19:59:30.880
It involves a bank robbery Okay.

Speaker 2: 
19:59:31.200-19:59:37.680
So we're going to apply the principles to like these cases, and they're cases that come up a lot in the evidence law.

Speaker 2: 
19:59:38.000-19:59:45.620
You'll often see cases pretty much in every evidence text that you get.

Speaker 2: 
19:59:45.939-19:59:48.260
But we'll start with Smith and the Queen.

Speaker 2: 
19:59:48.420-19:59:53.140
So this is probably the most important case of relevance in Australian law.

Speaker 2: 
19:59:53.460-20:00:03.520
And it shows how subtle, I would say, but also important how important relevance analysis can be.

Speaker 2: 
20:00:03.740-20:00:05.100
So facts of the case.

Speaker 2: 
20:00:06.140-20:00:15.380
There was a bank robbery by four young men, and all of these men were captured clearly on security cameras There was no dispute about the robbery itself, right?

Speaker 2: 
20:00:15.460-20:00:17.780
So we're not disputing that the robbery happened.

Speaker 2: 
20:00:18.100-20:00:24.380
The issue was whether the appellant was one of the four robbers shown in the photographs.

Speaker 2: 
20:00:24.860-20:00:30.620
So we're talking about the appellant because we're talking about that there was a subsequent appeal from a conviction.

Speaker 2: 
20:00:30.320-20:00:38.640
So two police officers had previous dealings with the appellant, and they both testified that they recognized him in security photos.

Speaker 2: 
20:00:38.960-20:00:44.080
The defense subsequently objected to this identification evidence on relevance grounds.

Speaker 2: 
20:00:44.580-20:00:50.580
Basically, there was no suggestion that the appellant's appearance had changed between the robbery and the trial.

Speaker 2: 
20:00:50.899-20:00:58.720
And by the end of the trial, the jury had probably spent more time observing the appellant than the police officers in their previous encounters.

Speaker 2: 
20:00:58.960-20:01:01.359
Okay, so that was the primary issue.

Speaker 2: 
20:01:01.600-20:01:05.279
Was the appellant actually one of those robbers in the photos?

Speaker 2: 
20:01:05.920-20:01:10.720
All right, we're seeing where the relevance is coming into, right?

Speaker 2: 
20:01:12.860-20:01:15.180
Okay, because we can see here we've got a relevance question.

Speaker 2: 
20:01:15.340-20:01:23.340
So could the police evidence rationally affect the jury's assessment of that probability that, that person at trial is the person in the photos?

Speaker 2: 
20:01:23.521-20:01:23.840
Right.

Speaker 2: 
20:01:24.000-20:01:29.360
So we can see how the main question here is, really, is that the right person?

Speaker 2: 
20:01:29.601-20:01:29.760
Okay?

Speaker 2: 
20:01:29.920-20:01:30.960
Because that's a facted issue.

Speaker 2: 
20:01:31.040-20:01:32.720
That's an ultimate fact issue.

Speaker 2: 
20:01:32.880-20:01:34.080
Is that person there?

Speaker 2: 
20:01:34.980-20:01:36.580
Right, exactly.

Speaker 2: 
20:01:37.140-20:01:42.740
So the High Court's approach emphasized that relevance is always the first question.

Speaker 2: 
20:01:43.060-20:01:55.220
And this will be drilled in this semester because because ultimately, the first question is we need to know if the evidence is going to be relevant and whether it's relevant or not.

Speaker 2: 
20:01:55.540-20:02:01.060
If it's not relevant, no further questions arise, but whether or not it's Admissible.

Speaker 2: 
20:02:01.300-20:02:01.540
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
20:02:01.859-20:02:05.460
So there'll be conjecture about whether or not something is actually admissible.

Speaker 2: 
20:02:05.779-20:02:09.140
Now, there's also about identifying the fact in issue, right?

Speaker 2: 
20:02:09.300-20:02:12.580
To be very familiar to you, even just after this session.

Speaker 2: 
20:02:12.521-20:02:26.601
But in this case, the court was very precise about the ultimate fact, which was whether the appellant, the person that was standing, was the person depicted in some of the security photographs.

Speaker 2: 
20:02:27.460-20:02:27.940
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
20:02:28.180-20:02:32.660
So but it's important to note that notice the present tense, okay.

Speaker 2: 
20:02:32.820-20:02:36.340
So it wasn't was the appellant in the bank during the robbery.

Speaker 2: 
20:02:36.660-20:02:40.900
It's is the person at trial the same person shown in the photos.

Speaker 2: 
20:02:40.960-20:02:42.800
Okay, so we don't want to know was it that person?

Speaker 2: 
20:02:42.880-20:02:47.680
We want to know if the person that is here, the same person in the photos.

Speaker 2: 
20:02:48.000-20:02:50.399
So, applying section 55.

Speaker 2: 
20:02:50.440-20:02:57.480
The question was, like I said here, is whether or not this evidence could rationally affect that assessment.

Speaker 2: 
20:02:58.120-20:03:01.240
So the court's analysis, which is very interesting.

Speaker 2: 
20:03:01.561-20:03:04.660
The police officer's conclusion was based on what?

Speaker 2: 
20:03:04.820-20:03:05.540
What was it based on?

Speaker 2: 
20:03:05.700-20:03:06.820
We spoke about it previously.

Speaker 2: 
20:03:07.141-20:03:10.820
What did the police base the fact that this was the same person on?

Speaker 2: 
20:03:14.680-20:03:15.800
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
20:03:16.120-20:03:26.061
The observation of the appellant's appearance from previous encounters, right, because they had previous dealings Their operations in what?

Speaker 2: 
20:03:26.221-20:03:27.021
What do they see?

Speaker 2: 
20:03:27.261-20:03:29.341
What evidence was before the court?

Speaker 2: 
20:03:39.340-20:03:40.619
Yeah, photos.

Speaker 2: 
20:03:41.260-20:03:44.040
So their observation of the photographs.

Speaker 2: 
20:03:44.120-20:03:46.200
So they were able to say, well, yeah, this is the same person.

Speaker 2: 
20:03:46.520-20:03:56.359
But the jury's conclusion would be based on their observation of the appellant's appearance during the trial and their observation of same photographs.

Speaker 2: 
20:03:57.040-20:04:12.220
Now these data sets were pretty or essentially identical, and the court held that the officer's conclusion couldn't rationally affect the jury's ass Okay, so we couldn't we couldn't affect the degree's assessment of whether or not it was the same person.

Speaker 2: 
20:04:12.860-20:04:15.660
Okay, so this will make some more sense in a minute.

Speaker 2: 
20:04:16.580-20:04:17.380
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
20:04:18.340-20:04:18.660
All right.

Speaker 2: 
20:04:18.740-20:04:24.980
So I think it's really important I'm just going to read you a quote from the actual court case.

Speaker 2: 
20:04:25.021-20:04:47.560
Okay, because the witness's assertion of identity was founded on material no different from the material available to the jury, The witness's assertion that he recognized the appellant is not evidence that could rationally affect the assessment of the jury of the question we have So basically, this reasoning rests on this insight about logical relevance.

Speaker 2: 
20:04:47.800-20:04:59.820
The police officers were essentially saying, based on our observations of the appellant in the photos, we conclude that they show the same person But the jury could make the exact same comparison using the exact same information.

Speaker 2: 
20:05:00.141-20:05:01.580
Does that make sense?

Speaker 2: 
20:05:05.341-20:05:05.980
Awesome.

Speaker 2: 
20:05:06.221-20:05:09.580
So like for example, okay, so I'll give you an example.

Speaker 2: 
20:05:09.900-20:05:20.380
If I was to ask you to compare two photographs to see if they showed the same person And then I ask someone else who's seen the same photos to give you their opinion.

Speaker 2: 
20:05:20.620-20:05:22.380
Does that opinion help you?

Speaker 2: 
20:05:26.920-20:05:27.240
No.

Speaker 2: 
20:05:27.480-20:05:28.920
And it why doesn't it help you?

Speaker 2: 
20:05:29.000-20:05:30.920
Because you have access to the same information.

Speaker 2: 
20:05:31.080-20:05:33.320
It doesn't give you any new information.

Speaker 2: 
20:05:33.400-20:05:34.840
You've just looked at the two photos.

Speaker 2: 
20:05:35.080-20:05:38.600
I've shown these two photos, the same photos to someone else of this person.

Speaker 2: 
20:05:38.920-20:05:39.880
Does it really help you?

Speaker 2: 
20:05:40.040-20:05:43.480
Not really, because it's like, you know, you've got the same information.

Speaker 2: 
20:05:43.640-20:05:45.080
It's no new information, right?

Speaker 2: 
20:05:45.160-20:05:46.440
There's nothing that can.

Speaker 2: 
20:05:46.641-20:05:48.641
really change what you already know.

Speaker 2: 
20:05:48.960-20:05:50.240
So it's not, does that make sense?

Speaker 2: 
20:05:50.320-20:05:52.480
Does that kind of help a bit more?

Speaker 2: 
20:05:53.120-20:05:53.920
Yeah, sweet.

Speaker 2: 
20:05:54.240-20:05:54.641
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
20:05:55.700-20:06:01.780
So, it's not about the reliability of the police officers or, you know, I guess their credibility.

Speaker 2: 
20:06:02.021-20:06:13.620
It's about logical relev whether their opinion could rationally affect the jury's assessment when the jury had access to the same basic information on appeal.

Speaker 2: 
20:06:13.320-20:06:13.880
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
20:06:14.200-20:06:21.800
So the court emphasized that basically someone else can reach a conclusion about the identity of the accused.

Speaker 2: 
20:06:23.021-20:06:27.101
but it doesn't necessarily provide a logical basis for changing that assessment.

Speaker 2: 
20:06:27.340-20:06:27.660
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
20:06:27.900-20:06:30.540
So it doesn't it doesn't veer away really.

Speaker 2: 
20:06:31.340-20:06:36.480
Lauren has said It's like, oh, and Montana said, therefore, it wasn't that reliable.

Speaker 2: 
20:06:36.960-20:06:38.160
Exactly, exactly right.

Speaker 2: 
20:06:38.480-20:06:41.681
And Lauren said, it's like identifying someone over the phone.

Speaker 2: 
20:06:41.840-20:06:45.760
Anyone who knows someone long enough can answer personal questions that might be to ID someone.

Speaker 2: 
20:06:46.000-20:06:46.960
So on.

Speaker 2: 
20:06:47.620-20:06:49.540
And then there are there are two different evidence.

Speaker 2: 
20:06:49.700-20:06:53.061
One is a photo itself and one is the witness evidence by police.

Speaker 2: 
20:06:53.381-20:07:13.460
So what they will do, it's called identification evidence And so essentially the police officers' evidence, they were able to identify the person from their previous dealings, but also a photo themselves So it's sort of like I would say it's more or so identification evidence that falls under that umbrella.

Speaker 2: 
20:07:14.340-20:07:18.479
A person is testimony could bias that conclusion.

Speaker 2: 
20:07:19.760-20:07:24.399
So we're looking at there is more so access to the same information.

Speaker 2: 
20:07:24.720-20:07:33.920
So if they were to show a new photograph, right, that hadn't previously been brought before, that might change it.

Speaker 2: 
20:07:34.080-20:07:40.220
Yeah, that completely might change it So I feel like it's quite interesting though.

Speaker 2: 
20:07:40.300-20:07:47.180
So what I guess the main consideration here is if you've got access to the same information, it doesn't really change much.

Speaker 2: 
20:07:47.700-20:08:04.160
Um so why this matters is the principle serves as a protection against the risk that juries might give undue weight to witness opinions just because they come from authority figures.

Speaker 2: 
20:08:04.400-20:08:10.600
And this is why it's really, really interest this is exactly the um the point Gray was trying To make.

Speaker 2: 
20:08:10.920-20:08:25.520
So, even when those opinions aren't based on superior information or expertise, so we're basically saying that just because that person's a police officer, and they have access to the same information as the jury doesn't mean it should be provided with more weight because ultimately, it's about the evidence, right?

Speaker 2: 
20:08:29.120-20:08:29.521
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
20:08:30.160-20:08:33.200
When identification is relevant.

Speaker 2: 
20:08:33.840-20:08:44.239
Okay, so this decision, like don't get confused with whether or not this means identification evidence is never relevant because of course it will be relevant and there's going to be several examples.

Speaker 2: 
20:08:46.040-20:08:47.400
Where it is relevant.

Speaker 2: 
20:08:47.721-20:08:49.801
So the case of Goodall.

Speaker 2: 
20:08:50.040-20:08:54.761
So in that case, officers saw a defendant wearing a jacket before a robbery.

Speaker 2: 
20:08:54.920-20:08:56.280
This is a different case.

Speaker 2: 
20:08:56.040-20:08:59.240
and then identified him wearing the same jacket in robbery photos.

Speaker 2: 
20:08:59.560-20:09:08.181
So that was relevant because it connected the defendant to physical evidence, so aka the jacket that was found with other incriminating items.

Speaker 2: 
20:09:08.340-20:09:11.300
Okay, so that could be for identification purposes.

Speaker 2: 
20:09:11.620-20:09:13.061
Appearance changes.

Speaker 2: 
20:09:13.300-20:09:23.160
So So for example, if the accused's appearance changes at trial and it might be different to how they appeared at the time of the offence.

Speaker 2: 
20:09:23.240-20:09:30.520
Evidence can be given from someone who knew how the accused looked at the time of the offence, and that wouldn't be considered irrelevant.

Speaker 2: 
20:09:30.680-20:09:34.000
You could totally call someone and say, well, how did they look at Time, right?

Speaker 2: 
20:09:34.320-20:09:37.920
So that's totally, oh, that could be totally relevant.

Speaker 2: 
20:09:38.240-20:09:39.601
Distinctive features.

Speaker 2: 
20:09:39.920-20:09:42.641
So I'm just thinking.

Speaker 2: 
20:09:44.340-20:09:57.859
Right, so if there was a distinctive feature of the person that was revealed by, you know, in the photographs, so for example, if they walked in a certain way, or maybe they kicked their legs up every time they walked, and there might be a video.

Speaker 2: 
20:09:58.560-20:10:00.880
And this wouldn't be apparent to a jury member, right?

Speaker 2: 
20:10:01.119-20:10:05.119
So things that are not always visible when you're looking at a person or an accused person.

Speaker 2: 
20:10:05.439-20:10:14.100
So the witness might come forward and talk about different mannerisms or characteristics that are not visible when the defendant is sitting in a dock.

Speaker 2: 
20:10:14.740-20:10:16.500
Then you've got different photographs as well.

Speaker 2: 
20:10:16.740-20:10:26.360
So where there's an issue where the photographs or different incidences depict a similar person, identification evidence connecting them could still be relevant.

Speaker 2: 
20:10:26.680-20:10:29.560
So there's a few different cases that followed Smith.

Speaker 2: 
20:10:30.200-20:10:36.840
I know we're running out of time, so I won't go into them in too much detail, but I do implore you to have a look as well.

Speaker 2: 
20:10:37.520-20:10:40.960
If there was just four of this probably it was just yes, that's right, it was just Smith.

Speaker 2: 
20:10:41.359-20:10:43.600
Only one of them brought the appeal.

Speaker 2: 
20:10:44.960-20:10:46.080
Interestingly.

Speaker 2: 
20:10:46.320-20:10:50.320
So have a bit of a look at a couple of these cases.

Speaker 2: 
20:10:50.960-20:10:51.440
Interesting.

Speaker 2: 
20:10:51.600-20:10:53.520
This is about identification evidence.

Speaker 2: 
20:10:53.680-20:10:56.760
Now Well really, this is more so fundamental.

Speaker 2: 
20:10:56.920-20:11:06.040
We're going to go into much more detail about what identification evidence is, but I think it's important to set you all up from the outset so these terms start to become really familiar to you.

Speaker 2: 
20:11:06.520-20:11:14.439
So yeah, just don't worry if you're like, this is really confusing, I don't understand what we need to like this entails, or this is like a lot of information.

Speaker 2: 
20:11:14.760-20:11:19.399
It's just more to familiarize yourselves with the different types of evidence.

Speaker 2: 
20:11:19.720-20:11:20.200
Okay?

Speaker 2: 
20:11:21.040-20:11:44.700
So I guess the overarching principle here is that identification evidence is relevant when the witness has information, perspective or opportunity for observation that a jury might lack So when a witness and the jury are essentially in the same position, the evidence lacks logical relevance under section fifty five of subsection one.

Speaker 2: 
20:11:44.859-20:11:47.740
So essentially, we need to bring something different.

Speaker 2: 
20:11:48.580-20:11:50.820
All righty, so we don't have too much time left.

Speaker 2: 
20:11:50.980-20:11:57.859
So I'm going to try and let me see, what should we talk about So these things we will cover down the track.

Speaker 2: 
20:11:57.939-20:12:02.979
So I don't know how much I want to go into detail here because of the time.

Speaker 2: 
20:12:03.780-20:12:04.420
frame.

Speaker 2: 
20:12:04.660-20:12:08.420
I'll quickly okay, I'm going to quickly go over this, okay, just super quickly.

Speaker 2: 
20:12:08.740-20:12:11.460
All right, only because it flows on from what we were learning.

Speaker 2: 
20:12:11.700-20:12:22.859
So Fausen, this case, went all the way to the High Court, and it predominantly looks at relevance and circumstantial evidence.

Speaker 2: 
20:12:22.620-20:12:28.300
So like we spoke about before, circumstantial evidence works cumulatively.

Speaker 2: 
20:12:28.620-20:12:43.500
So for example, Someone having cash alone might not prove an intent to traffic or intent to traffic drugs, but then, for example, combined with other evidence, it might create a more compelling picture.

Speaker 2: 
20:12:43.700-20:12:47.540
In this case, it obviously involved drug trafficking.

Speaker 2: 
20:12:47.700-20:12:49.939
There were some plants at a property.

Speaker 2: 
20:12:50.180-20:12:53.939
There was $120,000 hidden in the defendant's home.

Speaker 2: 
20:12:54.980-20:13:04.340
And basically what they were trying to establish is whether or not all that cash proved that there was an attempt to traffic.

Speaker 2: 
20:13:05.820-20:13:13.340
So again, I'm going to just speed through this because we'll again talk a bit more about this at a later date.

Speaker 2: 
20:13:13.660-20:13:22.740
But we look at things like timing, we look at commercial dog okay, for example, timing, right.

Speaker 2: 
20:13:22.819-20:13:29.500
So if you're looking at this particular case and you're looking at whether or not the cache is relevant.

Speaker 2: 
20:13:30.140-20:13:40.859
Why would okay, if this case was about a commercial trafficking, for example, trafficking opportunity, why would timing be really important?

Speaker 2: 
20:13:41.560-20:13:50.920
or continuity be really important if you're looking at like a trafficking thing charge offence.

Speaker 2: 
20:13:52.780-20:13:56.380
Do commercial drug operations appear overnight?

Speaker 2: 
20:13:56.700-20:13:58.860
Or do you think they develop over time?

Speaker 2: 
20:14:04.159-20:14:05.920
Yes, okay, excellent.

Speaker 2: 
20:14:06.239-20:14:14.399
And so if there was a large amount of cash hidden at a defendant's home, do you think it could suggest an ongoing operation?

Speaker 2: 
20:14:19.040-20:14:19.521
It could.

Speaker 2: 
20:14:19.840-20:14:23.200
Could it suggest that alone without all this other evidence?

Speaker 2: 
20:14:23.360-20:14:27.681
Let's say there was just like one hundred twenty thousand dollars randomly found at a person's home?

Speaker 2: 
20:14:27.780-20:14:30.819
you'd automatically go, okay, yep, they're thinking drugs.

Speaker 2: 
20:14:32.740-20:14:33.380
Not exactly.

Speaker 2: 
20:14:33.540-20:14:42.359
That's right, because we again, we need all of those puzzle pieces So what about if we look at ah yes, suspicious.

Speaker 2: 
20:14:42.439-20:14:43.960
It is suspicious, 100%.

Speaker 2: 
20:14:44.040-20:14:53.841
But that's right, there's so many different explanations Yes, if anyone finds it in their home, that would be, yeah, I would love finding 120 grand in my home as well.

Speaker 2: 
20:14:55.580-20:14:56.060
Sorry.

Speaker 2: 
20:14:56.220-20:14:56.460
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
20:14:56.699-20:15:02.460
So we also look at responses to alternative theories.

Speaker 2: 
20:15:02.619-20:15:02.939
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
20:15:03.180-20:15:07.899
So what if the defendant claimed that the cannabis was for personal use?

Speaker 2: 
20:15:08.159-20:15:10.800
and for personal use only.

Speaker 2: 
20:15:10.960-20:15:11.359
What do you think?

Speaker 2: 
20:15:11.520-20:15:18.479
Do you think that, that would make a commercial trafficking scheme less plausible?

Speaker 2: 
20:15:27.100-20:15:33.420
I mean, I would probably say not only because it's like how would we but only because we don't know, right?

Speaker 2: 
20:15:33.500-20:15:34.780
So what would we ask them?

Speaker 2: 
20:15:35.320-20:15:37.000
What would we want to find out?

Speaker 2: 
20:15:39.560-20:15:41.320
Yep, so we've got a few comments here.

Speaker 2: 
20:15:41.800-20:15:43.000
Excellent.

Speaker 2: 
20:15:43.760-20:15:44.080
Yep.

Speaker 2: 
20:15:44.240-20:15:48.000
So it asked them where did the money come from?

Speaker 2: 
20:15:48.320-20:15:50.641
How often do you do drugs?

Speaker 2: 
20:15:50.960-20:15:52.561
What was the purpose?

Speaker 2: 
20:15:52.881-20:15:56.721
if not to fund your continued operations, for example.

Speaker 2: 
20:15:57.601-20:15:58.080
Exactly.

Speaker 2: 
20:15:58.240-20:16:00.561
So you get, do you distill for oil?

Speaker 2: 
20:16:00.881-20:16:18.240
So there are a number of different things, right, that you could ask them Then another issue in this particular or drug trafficking offences as a whole was that the cache itself might show it's linked to other offences.

Speaker 2: 
20:16:18.560-20:16:20.160
So it doesn't mean it's inadmissible, right?

Speaker 2: 
20:16:20.240-20:16:21.760
So we're not trying to say it's inadmissible.

Speaker 2: 
20:16:22.160-20:16:31.820
What we're trying to say is we're trying to establish an intent there that the defendant actually used this used the drugs to traffic.

Speaker 2: 
20:16:31.980-20:16:36.540
So we're using the different kinds of evidence to, I guess, build a picture Show here.

Speaker 2: 
20:16:36.780-20:16:39.260
So that's the important distinction.

Speaker 2: 
20:16:39.500-20:16:44.540
That's the important, I guess, distinction between relevance and propensity.

Speaker 2: 
20:16:44.860-20:16:48.620
And we'll learn about tendency and propensity and whatnot down the track.

Speaker 2: 
20:16:49.239-20:16:54.439
But ultimately, evidence can be relevant for nonpropensity reasons.

Speaker 2: 
20:16:54.760-20:16:58.979
So and this is even if it incidentally suggests past Misconduct.

Speaker 2: 
20:16:59.060-20:17:03.380
So, what we're trying to identify though is a logical connection to the facts that are currently at issue.

Speaker 2: 
20:17:03.699-20:17:12.500
So, if we're trying to figure out whether or not someone is engaged in a commercial trafficking scheme, we need to look at what the facts as they currently stand, right?

Speaker 7: 
20:17:19.420-20:17:19.900
Okay.

Speaker 7: 
20:17:21.820-20:17:26.780
Ah, sorry, my my um slide is

Speaker 2: 
20:17:26.940-20:17:28.141
Loading.

Speaker 2: 
20:17:30.061-20:17:30.381
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
20:17:30.860-20:17:31.181
Sorry.

Speaker 2: 
20:17:31.341-20:17:32.141
I don't know what's happened.

Speaker 2: 
20:17:32.301-20:17:35.181
Is every can everyone see the slide or is it just not loading?

Speaker 7: 
20:17:37.380-20:17:38.979
Oh, you can see the slide?

Speaker 7: 
20:17:39.300-20:17:40.500
Oh, I can't see the slide.

Speaker 7: 
20:17:40.580-20:17:41.540
That's so annoying.

Speaker 7: 
20:17:41.859-20:17:42.819
How weird.

Speaker 2: 
20:17:43.460-20:17:44.020
Oh, no.

Speaker 2: 
20:17:44.340-20:17:44.580
All right.

Speaker 2: 
20:17:44.659-20:17:45.460
Well, I can't see it.

Speaker 2: 
20:17:45.540-20:17:46.180
That's really afraid.

Speaker 2: 
20:17:46.340-20:17:49.220
Okay, I'm just going to just bear with me a tick.

Speaker 2: 
20:17:52.120-20:17:54.280
Just bear with me a tick.

Speaker 2: 
20:17:56.520-20:17:57.000
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
20:17:57.560-20:17:58.439
Amazing.

Speaker 2: 
20:17:58.760-20:18:01.000
Now my internet's being really slow.

Speaker 2: 
20:18:02.181-20:18:04.980
Okay, sorry everyone, I don't really know what's happened there.

Speaker 4: 
20:18:05.301-20:18:06.021
Ah, here we go.

Speaker 4: 
20:18:06.341-20:18:08.341
We're on slide twenty four, right?

Speaker 4: 
20:18:13.640-20:18:25.080
Oh no, I think the connections it's just with me but I think the technical difficult

Speaker 2: 
20:18:26.860-20:18:27.500
This is with the things.

Speaker 2: 
20:18:27.580-20:18:31.260
I normally turn it on in the week twelve though, and then just like risk it being terrible.

Speaker 2: 
20:18:31.420-20:18:48.319
So then you can actually see that I am a real person Okay, so it's still loading for me, but what I might do is move on to Let's just move on to a little activity because we don't have a lot of time.

Speaker 2: 
20:18:50.240-20:18:51.520
Let's have a bit of a look.

Speaker 2: 
20:18:51.760-20:18:52.399
Ah, here we go.

Speaker 2: 
20:18:52.560-20:18:53.120
All right.

Speaker 7: 
20:18:53.681-20:18:54.561
I might.

Speaker 7: 
20:18:57.200-20:19:02.400
Okay, give me a quick second because I'm going to see what we need to talk about.

Speaker 7: 
20:19:04.561-20:19:05.040
Let's see.

Speaker 7: 
20:19:05.200-20:19:05.760
Could we do that?

Speaker 7: 
20:19:05.840-20:19:07.040
Let's have a look.

Speaker 2: 
20:19:08.660-20:19:15.780
Maybe do you like a quick okay, I can't see the slide, but as long as you can see it, that's fine.

Speaker 2: 
20:19:16.020-20:19:17.540
Oh, you can okay, great.

Speaker 2: 
20:19:17.820-20:19:22.780
Alrighty, we'll just do like a little quick relevance exercise.

Speaker 2: 
20:19:23.020-20:19:26.060
So I'll present a scenario and I'll walk you through the analysis.

Speaker 2: 
20:19:26.140-20:19:28.380
So this will probably help, hopefully.

Speaker 2: 
20:19:28.301-20:19:28.860
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
20:19:29.181-20:19:31.101
So we'll call it the bullet box.

Speaker 2: 
20:19:31.181-20:19:34.141
It's based on Rodi and the Queen.

Speaker 2: 
20:19:34.460-20:19:39.979
And ultimately It's about a drug supply prosecution.

Speaker 2: 
20:19:40.300-20:19:54.979
The police search the defendant's car following his arrest And they find nine hundred ninety one grams of meth in a sports bag on the front seat, and they also find a box of bullets in the passenger door pocket, so just on the side of the door.

Speaker 2: 
20:19:55.120-20:20:01.840
The Crown wants to use the bullet evidence as an indictum of drug supply.

Speaker 2: 
20:20:02.160-20:20:05.520
So arguing that the bullets suggest handgun possession.

Speaker 2: 
20:20:05.760-20:20:09.080
So what's commonly associated with drug trafficking ultimately.

Speaker 2: 
20:20:09.160-20:20:12.200
So they're trying to say that they there's a correlation there.

Speaker 2: 
20:20:12.520-20:20:18.680
So if we apply section fifty five subsection one, what's the facts in issue here?

Speaker 2: 
20:20:19.021-20:20:23.101
What does the Crown need to prove drug supply?

Speaker 2: 
20:20:23.420-20:20:25.740
Think about the elements.

Speaker 2: 
20:20:33.500-20:20:38.540
Yes, so we want to look at yes, so we want to look at the drug supply specifically.

Speaker 2: 
20:20:39.181-20:20:40.780
What are our facts including?

Speaker 2: 
20:20:41.261-20:20:42.700
What are we going to do?

Speaker 2: 
20:20:43.859-20:20:45.460
What's the evidence?

Speaker 2: 
20:20:50.500-20:20:51.380
Yep, okay, excellent.

Speaker 2: 
20:20:51.460-20:20:52.899
So we've got possession.

Speaker 2: 
20:20:53.021-20:20:54.940
First and foremost, possession of the drug.

Speaker 2: 
20:20:55.181-20:20:59.021
Okay, we need to look at substantially how this came about in the first place, right?

Speaker 2: 
20:20:59.181-20:21:01.021
So we've got possession of the drug.

Speaker 2: 
20:21:01.320-20:21:02.360
What else are we looking at?

Speaker 2: 
20:21:02.440-20:21:03.720
We've also got so here we go.

Speaker 2: 
20:21:03.800-20:21:05.640
All right, so we've got possession of this drug.

Speaker 2: 
20:21:05.960-20:21:08.440
Now, nine hundred ninety one grams of meth.

Speaker 2: 
20:21:08.520-20:21:09.160
That's a lot.

Speaker 2: 
20:21:09.480-20:21:09.880
What do you think?

Speaker 2: 
20:21:09.960-20:21:12.280
Do you think that could just be for personal use?

Speaker 2: 
20:21:16.520-20:21:16.840
No.

Speaker 2: 
20:21:17.160-20:21:21.720
So having an end gun alone ought not necessarily demonstrate drug supply.

Speaker 2: 
20:21:21.660-20:21:26.140
but it can often be associated with drug trafficking or those incidences.

Speaker 2: 
20:21:26.380-20:21:34.180
But here, what we primarily want to look at is whether or not the Crown can prove Drug supply.

Speaker 2: 
20:21:34.500-20:21:36.900
So this is where it's like kind of tricky, right?

Speaker 2: 
20:21:37.060-20:21:38.820
Because we have to ignore, right?

Speaker 2: 
20:21:39.620-20:21:40.580
There's a handgun, right?

Speaker 2: 
20:21:40.660-20:21:43.420
But primarily the question is What are we trying to prove?

Speaker 2: 
20:21:43.580-20:21:46.060
Remember, we talked about cases where we're looking at robbery.

Speaker 2: 
20:21:46.220-20:21:47.899
We talked about cases where we're looking at murder.

Speaker 2: 
20:21:48.220-20:21:49.899
What's the overarching issue?

Speaker 2: 
20:21:50.060-20:21:54.140
Well, we're trying to prove that this person had possession with intent to spy.

Speaker 2: 
20:21:54.380-20:21:54.780
Yeah?

Speaker 2: 
20:21:55.780-20:22:00.660
So we've got intent to supply, might not be just be for personal use, that's a lot of meth.

Speaker 2: 
20:22:00.899-20:22:02.660
So are they carrying a commercial quantity?

Speaker 2: 
20:22:02.899-20:22:03.140
Yeah.

Speaker 2: 
20:22:03.460-20:22:03.780
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
20:22:04.420-20:22:17.601
So step two, we need to identify the proposed logical connection So it was brought up before there's bullets, there's a handgun, this could be indicative of a drug supply.

Speaker 2: 
20:22:17.920-20:22:24.319
Now this is how we have to establish But this is how we're piecing together the evidence.

Speaker 2: 
20:22:24.640-20:22:37.960
Now if we look at what could rationally affect the fact finder Could evidence of bullets, if accepted, rationally affect the assessment of whether the defendant intended to supply commercially?

Speaker 2: 
20:22:38.040-20:22:39.000
What do you think?

Speaker 2: 
20:22:40.320-20:22:41.440
There's no right or wrong answers.

Speaker 2: 
20:22:41.521-20:22:44.240
It's just a good way to just kind of put it into practice.

Speaker 2: 
20:22:44.400-20:22:45.360
What do you think?

Speaker 2: 
20:22:46.960-20:22:48.400
Yeah, probably.

Speaker 2: 
20:22:48.720-20:22:49.440
I reckon.

Speaker 2: 
20:22:49.760-20:22:50.720
I reckon it could.

Speaker 2: 
20:22:50.960-20:23:01.380
Now if we're looking at our analysis, Does human experience like our own human experiences show a connection between having a firearm and commercial drug operations?

Speaker 2: 
20:23:01.540-20:23:02.660
What do you think?

Speaker 2: 
20:23:04.200-20:23:07.080
Just from our human experiences, yeah?

Speaker 2: 
20:23:07.720-20:23:09.320
And it's like why, right?

Speaker 2: 
20:23:09.560-20:23:14.520
Well, commercial drug dealers obviously carry weapons for, yep, prepare for violence, protection.

Speaker 2: 
20:23:14.641-20:23:17.761
They often involve large monetary amounts.

Speaker 2: 
20:23:18.080-20:23:20.320
They face threats from competitors, customers.

Speaker 2: 
20:23:20.641-20:23:27.640
Also, personal use consumers don't typically need weapons for drug related activities as well.

Speaker 2: 
20:23:27.960-20:23:32.840
So we have to also consider some alternative explanations too as well.

Speaker 2: 
20:23:33.080-20:23:35.880
So could we explain the bullets by certain factors?

Speaker 2: 
20:23:36.040-20:23:47.960
Like are they yes, are they Sport that they engage in, like recreational shooting or hunting, unrelated criminal activity, et cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 2: 
20:23:48.601-20:23:56.359
So, in terms of this case and Ah, yep, do they have a license, hunting, prejudicial character?

Speaker 2: 
20:23:56.600-20:23:57.640
There's lots of different things here.

Speaker 2: 
20:23:57.800-20:23:58.760
Excellent, everyone.

Speaker 2: 
20:23:59.080-20:24:03.000
So the actual court decision was that the bullet evidence was missable.

Speaker 2: 
20:24:03.920-20:24:18.740
stating that possessions of bullets may be used in a handgun in circumstances in which it is alleged that the person has a future purpose of supplying drugs It is clearly in the category of sorry, indicium of supply.

Speaker 2: 
20:24:19.061-20:24:21.460
So ultimately, context matters.

Speaker 2: 
20:24:21.700-20:24:28.720
So remember, same relevance might be irrelevant in different circumstances Like we spoke about, there is a low threshold of relevance.

Speaker 2: 
20:24:28.880-20:24:30.720
It doesn't need to prove the fact, yeah?

Speaker 2: 
20:24:30.960-20:24:46.200
It just needs to affect the probability Now we also need to remember that there are alternative explanations, and alternative explanations don't necessarily destroy relevance if the proposed connection is reasonable.

Speaker 2: 
20:24:46.520-20:24:46.840
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
20:24:47.320-20:24:50.120
Now we'll do one more.

Speaker 2: 
20:24:52.200-20:25:04.580
Actually, we might not do this one because we already spoke about Neil and the Queen, and we've got like three minutes left Have a look through the slides though and have a look at Neil and the Queen.

Speaker 2: 
20:25:04.740-20:25:17.940
But ultimately, we're looking we kind of started through this one about rel But we can also come back to that one next week if you'd like.

Speaker 2: 
20:25:18.101-20:25:20.580
But I feel like we've kind of already discussed it.

Speaker 2: 
20:25:20.900-20:25:25.460
I don't know if my internet's coming out because it's got that red little mark again.

Speaker 2: 
20:25:25.440-20:25:27.760
Can everyone let me know if you can hear me?

Speaker 2: 
20:25:28.720-20:25:29.681
Yeah, sorry.

Speaker 2: 
20:25:30.000-20:25:31.681
I'm not sure what's going on there again.

Speaker 2: 
20:25:31.840-20:25:33.521
I do apologise.

Speaker 2: 
20:25:34.439-20:25:36.760
Oh no, sorry everyone.

Speaker 2: 
20:25:37.720-20:25:39.240
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

Speaker 2: 
20:25:39.880-20:25:42.120
Really don't know what's happening tonight.

Speaker 2: 
20:25:43.720-20:25:44.359
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
20:25:44.960-20:25:50.960
Hopefully, this comes back very soon, which I think it may.

Speaker 2: 
20:25:51.840-20:25:55.200
Okay, so let's wrap up.

Speaker 2: 
20:25:57.359-20:25:59.359
Oh, good, good, good, good.

Speaker 2: 
20:26:00.000-20:26:03.840
So what I'm going to do oh, that's going to be it.

Speaker 2: 
20:26:04.000-20:26:09.280
Hey, I didn't even realize the school holidays ago.

Speaker 2: 
20:26:10.200-20:26:11.400
That's so funny.

Speaker 2: 
20:26:11.721-20:26:19.400
All right, I'm just going to okay, so sorry, the main is completely like cocking it, but I might just do this really quick.

Speaker 2: 
20:26:19.721-20:26:20.920
Ah, okay.

Speaker 2: 
20:26:22.860-20:26:23.341
All right.

Speaker 2: 
20:26:23.660-20:26:35.021
I'm sorry, the technical difficulties are really annoying, but let's just do a quick little quiz, which I was trying to do

Speaker 7: 
20:26:37.040-20:26:37.680
Oh.

Speaker 7: 
20:26:38.000-20:26:42.400
Sorry, the link to I can't even see your comment.

Speaker 7: 
20:26:42.480-20:26:43.920
I don't know where it's called.

Speaker 7: 
20:26:44.580-20:26:44.899
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
20:26:45.140-20:26:52.739
So just for everyone's knowledge in general, the link to the collaborate sessions are in the workshop module for that week.

Speaker 2: 
20:26:52.899-20:26:56.859
It's just the general Court session, sorry, court session, collaborate session.

Speaker 2: 
20:26:57.100-20:27:07.520
That means everyone can access, and that's why I put those recordings under the workshop modules to So it's not individual, and that way you just all have access to it, and it's just a bit easier that way, and it's relevant.

Speaker 2: 
20:27:07.680-20:27:14.480
So to the to the that week, but you'll be able to find it there if that's easier.

Speaker 2: 
20:27:14.521-20:27:19.641
Alrighty, I feel like the technical difficulties are really gonna just cut me out here.

Speaker 2: 
20:27:19.960-20:27:29.820
But um I feel like what we might just do is wrap up because ultimately, the last few are going over a few things that we have already gone over.

Speaker 2: 
20:27:29.980-20:27:43.120
But what I do think would be good is to review the rest of the slides, it kind of just goes through a bit of circumstantial evidence and gives you a bit more of a rundown on that as well.

Speaker 2: 
20:27:43.359-20:27:47.399
So like I said, we're probably not going to be able to get through all of the content each week.

Speaker 2: 
20:27:47.640-20:27:56.760
It's really hard to like when you're writing these to try and time it to three hours because obviously things change and sometimes I go over or under.

Speaker 2: 
20:27:57.260-20:27:59.900
So I always try to I'll try to do my best.

Speaker 2: 
20:28:00.141-20:28:08.979
But ultimately, our key learnings for this evening are Number one, relevance is gateway.

Speaker 2: 
20:28:09.300-20:28:09.939
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
20:28:10.899-20:28:14.100
Relevance is and just oh, that's good.

Speaker 2: 
20:28:14.260-20:28:15.060
And I think we did too.

Speaker 2: 
20:28:15.220-20:28:18.819
And the last few slides were just a recap of what we've already discussed.

Speaker 2: 
20:28:18.899-20:28:24.180
It was just more of like a Past your knowledge, which you can also do in your own time if you want to.

Speaker 2: 
20:28:25.460-20:28:26.819
So girl, there we go.

Speaker 2: 
20:28:26.979-20:28:29.399
Key takeaways Relevance is a gateway.

Speaker 2: 
20:28:29.560-20:28:32.200
It's necessary, but it's not sufficient for admissibility.

Speaker 2: 
20:28:32.359-20:28:32.520
Okay?

Speaker 2: 
20:28:32.680-20:28:36.520
So remember, we've already got different exclusionary rules that we'll talk about.

Speaker 2: 
20:28:36.840-20:28:47.520
But think about it again like airport security You can't get on the plane without passing through security, but passing security doesn't guarantee you that your flight's not going to be cancelled for other reasons.

Speaker 2: 
20:28:47.840-20:28:52.080
Every piece of evidence in every case needs to pass Section five.

Speaker 2: 
20:28:52.399-20:28:59.580
If it's not relevant How reliable, important, or probative it might be, it can't be admitted.

Speaker 2: 
20:28:59.900-20:29:01.021
Now, number two.

Speaker 2: 
20:29:03.560-20:29:04.040
importance.

Speaker 2: 
20:29:04.279-20:29:11.159
So Section fifty five standard only requires a minimal logical connection, but the consequences are absolute.

Speaker 2: 
20:29:11.319-20:29:26.420
So evidence that doesn't meet this low threshold is completely inadmissible Now remember and it's better to admit borderline evidence than let the fact finder assess its weight than to exclude potentially useful information.

Speaker 2: 
20:29:26.580-20:29:33.979
Okay, so it's better to provide it and then to like you just you'd rather do that.

Speaker 2: 
20:29:34.300-20:29:36.300
So context always matters.

Speaker 2: 
20:29:36.619-20:29:41.580
The same piece of evidence can be highly relevant in one case and completely irrelevant in another.

Speaker 2: 
20:29:41.899-20:29:47.600
Relevance is going to depend on what facts are in issue in the particular proceeding.

Speaker 2: 
20:29:47.920-20:29:57.200
And that's why understanding the charges or legal elements will be really crucial Inference and speculation, we spoke a lot about that.

Speaker 2: 
20:29:57.440-20:30:09.260
There needs to be legitimate inference based on patterns of human experiences supported by evidence or common knowled Improper speculation ultimately relies on assumptions, stereotypes or connections established by evidence.

Speaker 2: 
20:30:09.819-20:30:11.819
So that's that.

Speaker 2: 
20:30:12.060-20:30:16.080
And then also Practical application matters.

Speaker 2: 
20:30:16.320-20:30:19.920
So making sure that you're thinking ahead when you're making your arguments.

Speaker 2: 
20:30:20.160-20:30:20.960
Okay.

Speaker 2: 
20:30:21.601-20:30:22.160
Alrighty.

Speaker 2: 
20:30:22.240-20:30:28.180
So next week We'll be having a look at obviously some different other kinds of evidence.

Speaker 2: 
20:30:28.260-20:30:31.619
I'll formulate that and we'll have a chat about that next week.

Speaker 2: 
20:30:31.779-20:30:35.200
But otherwise, if you have any questions in the meantime Please reach out.

Speaker 2: 
20:30:35.280-20:30:37.601
And look, thanks everyone for your participation tonight.

Speaker 4: 
20:30:37.761-20:30:43.920
I'm sorry about any of the technical difficulties, but thanks for bearing with me.

Speaker 4: 
20:30:44.641-20:30:46.641
I really appreciate everyone's participation.

Speaker 4: 
20:30:46.801-20:30:49.200
It means a lot, and I just it really does.

Speaker 4: 
20:30:49.360-20:30:50.960
