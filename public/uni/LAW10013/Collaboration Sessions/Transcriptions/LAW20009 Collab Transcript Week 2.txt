Speaker 1: 
00:01-00:02
Welcome.

Speaker 1: 
00:02-00:03
Welcome, everybody.

Speaker 1: 
00:04-00:05
I hope you're all well.

Speaker 1: 
00:05-00:07
Welcome to our session.

Speaker 1: 
00:07-00:07
Welcome.

Speaker 1: 
00:07-00:12
And one of the joys of joining us in person

Speaker 1: 
00:11-00:19
is the fact that and I'd like to thank you, Montana, for your rendition of

Speaker 1: 
00:19-00:24
Well, it's an African folk song, which I don't know anything about.

Speaker 1: 
00:24-00:27
So thank you very much for that tune.

Speaker 1: 
00:27-00:33
And you've just missed me singing I am warm I am Woman, Hear Me Roar as well.

Speaker 1: 
00:33-00:34
So

Speaker 1: 
00:34-00:45
Please do come to the sessions if you can, because you're missing out on this the ridiculousness of our pre-seminar entertainment.

Speaker 1: 
00:45-00:46
Now this week.

Speaker 2: 
00:47-00:48
What do you mean?

Speaker 1: 
00:49-00:49
Sorry?

Speaker 2: 
00:51-00:53
Sorry, I I just I was lost for a second.

Speaker 2: 
00:53-00:54
What was that?

Speaker 1: 
00:54-00:55
Oh, I know.

Speaker 1: 
00:55-01:00
I said, well, thank you for your rendition of the folk song that you sang before we went live.

Speaker 1: 
01:00-01:02
It was fantastic.

Speaker 1: 
01:02-01:04
You're ruining the illusion.

Speaker 1: 
01:04-01:12
I'm trying to create a spirit whereby students are missing sort of the excitement we have before we go on.

Speaker 2: 
01:13-01:14
Sorry, I'm following

Speaker 1: 
01:15-01:24
Oh, Montana, are you the kind of person that stands up in a magic trick, a magic show and says, I know exactly how they did that?

Speaker 1: 
01:25-01:26
But thank you.

Speaker 1: 
01:26-01:27
I do apologize.

Speaker 1: 
01:28-01:31
I should have alerted you to the hijinks that was to follow.

Speaker 1: 
01:32-01:37
Yes, we are doing Foot Loose, Nicholas, and as a podiatrist, I endorse that song.

Speaker 1: 
01:37-01:50
Now, as I'm legally required by law, I must ask the question whilst I'm sharing information, are you able to view this slide?

Speaker 1: 
01:53-01:57
Yes, you are, but why have I done the introduction?

Speaker 1: 
01:57-01:59
We are so past the introduction.

Speaker 1: 
02:01-02:02
Why did that happen?

Speaker 1: 
02:02-02:04
Oh, week one.

Speaker 1: 
02:04-02:07
We're so not week one.

Speaker 1: 
02:08-02:14
Today we're looking at sale of goods and areas of law that would relate to the sale of goods.

Speaker 1: 
02:15-02:26
So the thing that we need to consider, we said that, look, this area of law is quite laden with statute, for example

Speaker 1: 
02:25-02:29
Okay, so it's a statute full.

Speaker 1: 
02:30-02:34
What are some of the principles that we would

Speaker 1: 
02:34-02:38
focus on with regards to, for example, the sale of goods.

Speaker 1: 
02:38-02:40
Why would folks need protection?

Speaker 1: 
02:44-02:46
What's the importance of that?

Speaker 1: 
02:47-02:49
What are we hoping to achieve?

Speaker 1: 
02:56-02:57
Dodger goods won't be sold.

Speaker 1: 
02:57-02:58
Yes, we're hoping for that.

Speaker 1: 
02:59-03:00
Yes, yep.

Speaker 1: 
03:00-03:03
That puts a hole in my business model there.

Speaker 1: 
03:03-03:04
What else?

Speaker 1: 
03:04-03:06
What are you hoping for?

Speaker 1: 
03:06-03:08
Yeah, misleading and deceptive conduct.

Speaker 1: 
03:08-03:10
We're hoping to avoid it.

Speaker 1: 
03:12-03:14
What else are we hoping for?

Speaker 1: 
03:17-03:19
Accountability, yep.

Speaker 1: 
03:21-03:27
Remember that list we made last week, and we continue to make these lists of things

Speaker 1: 
03:27-03:39
so that we can employ them in a practical sense, so that we're doing we're going above and beyond acknowledging that this law exists and that law exists and this thing happens.

Speaker 1: 
03:39-03:41
And we say to ourselves, why?

Speaker 1: 
03:42-03:44
Why are we doing this?

Speaker 1: 
03:48-03:50
Thank you for your posts.

Speaker 1: 
03:51-03:51
Keep them coming.

Speaker 1: 
03:52-03:53
I respond to all of them.

Speaker 1: 
03:53-03:54
I'm like Sander.

Speaker 1: 
03:55-04:02
No correspondence goes to the best of my ability without response.

Speaker 1: 
04:03-04:08
And sorry if I burst anyone's sort of bubble regarding Sander.

Speaker 1: 
04:08-04:13
The thing to keep in mind is, I do want you please to post if you can.

Speaker 1: 
04:13-04:26
your responses to our weekly questions online, even if we will cover, for example, today the problem based scenario

Speaker 1: 
04:26-04:26
Thank you.

Speaker 1: 
04:27-04:39
And then on the weekend, I will go and respond to the problem that you are uploading and say, you know, I have to think about this, this is a good point and all that kind of stuff.

Speaker 1: 
04:40-04:43
But if you can do it during the week, that's great.

Speaker 1: 
04:43-04:51
If I don't get to that specific problem base, it's because also, you know, we don't want to sort of double handle things.

Speaker 1: 
04:51-04:53
We go through the problems

Speaker 1: 
04:54-05:04
But you'll see and feel free to read through each other's answers as well, because I might make a point in someone else's post that may also apply to you as well.

Speaker 1: 
05:06-05:11
Look, look at this legislation, who's pumped for legislation?

Speaker 1: 
05:16-05:24
Aren't we blessed to be studying law whereby the imagination, we don't need imagination.

Speaker 1: 
05:25-05:30
We want legislation about goods.

Speaker 1: 
05:30-05:35
So in Victoria's jurisdiction, Queensland was very early to the party

Speaker 1: 
05:36-05:40
Look at WA, gosh, is that the first thing WA has ever done in a hurry?

Speaker 1: 
05:43-05:47
Uh throwing a bit of shade down there to our Western Australian cousins.

Speaker 1: 
05:47-05:50
Um, yeah, no worries, Sally.

Speaker 1: 
05:50-05:51
No, folks, just post whatever.

Speaker 1: 
05:52-05:58
You post whatever you like and I'll go in there and I'll use a, you know, a a yellow color, a yellow font or something.

Speaker 1: 
05:58-05:58
Something.

Speaker 1: 
05:59-06:06
But just letting you know that I am reading the problem posts, but I'm not leaving you undelivered

Speaker 1: 
06:06-06:16
I'm leaving you on RET such that we can go through it today, and then you can augment or supplement your responses, and then I'll go in and comment on

Speaker 1: 
06:17-06:23
But the legislation that we're looking at really is the Goods Act 1958 of Victoria.

Speaker 1: 
06:24-06:28
And there is also an overlying

Speaker 1: 
06:29-06:33
regulatory framework, which we were introduced to last week.

Speaker 1: 
06:33-06:39
And what is our regulatory framework, for example, at the Commonwealth level?

Speaker 1: 
06:39-06:41
What do we refer to that as?

Speaker 1: 
06:45-06:46
It starts with A.

Speaker 1: 
06:49-06:49
Thank you.

Speaker 1: 
06:50-06:53
The ACL, Australian Consumer Law.

Speaker 1: 
06:53-06:54
Well done.

Speaker 1: 
06:54-07:00
Before I jump into all of this, does anyone have any queries or questions about this week, last week, any week?

Speaker 2: 
07:00-07:01
Nick?

Speaker 1: 
07:01-07:02
Yes.

Speaker 2: 
07:02-07:03
Sorry to be annoying.

Speaker 2: 
07:04-07:08
What did you hear about you probably heard about the Jeremy gym owner, Nicholas Solomas?

Speaker 1: 
07:10-07:12
Go ahead, let us know.

Speaker 2: 
07:13-07:21
Okay, so the director of Derrim at Jim, he owes approximately like 11 million

Speaker 2: 
07:20-07:25
dollars in unpaid taxes and some of the landlords are like closing down his gym.

Speaker 2: 
07:26-07:27
Have you heard about that?

Speaker 1: 
07:28-07:38
I've heard of the Derrima gym, but Montana, my sort of relationship with the Derrimut gym was that it was a Derrima gym and not all of the gyms were in Derrima.

Speaker 1: 
07:38-07:40
There were some gyms elsewhere, but go ahead.

Speaker 1: 
07:40-07:43
Yes, he has tax obligations, yeah.

Speaker 2: 
07:44-07:48
Yes, I think he's owing like a ten approximately ten million dollars.

Speaker 2: 
07:50-07:52
I'll put the link, give me one.

Speaker 1: 
07:52-07:53
Yes, yes.

Speaker 1: 
07:54-08:00
And what issues do you see with regards to that case?

Speaker 1: 
08:01-08:03
Please do bring these cases to us.

Speaker 1: 
08:10-08:16
And what did you find with regards to, say, the commercial law aspect of it?

Speaker 2: 
08:16-08:17
I didn't really find anything.

Speaker 2: 
08:17-08:20
I was just wondering if what like what you thought about it.

Speaker 1: 
08:20-08:22
Well, this is the thing, right?

Speaker 1: 
08:22-08:29
If that person goes bust, have they entered into contracts with the folks who've got gym memberships?

Speaker 2: 
08:31-08:33
Yes, correct.

Speaker 1: 
08:34-08:37
So what kind of and this is very good.

Speaker 1: 
08:37-08:39
That's why this is I love this.

Speaker 1: 
08:39-08:40
I love this.

Speaker 1: 
08:40-08:42
This is real time learning.

Speaker 1: 
08:42-08:56
we start to get into a situation where we say, well, hang on a flash, what actually happens to the individual agreements that that organization or corporation would have with its members?

Speaker 1: 
08:58-09:09
And who are, and we'll get to this in coming weeks, who are the types of debtors

Speaker 1: 
09:09-09:12
that would be first in line.

Speaker 1: 
09:14-09:23
So for example, do you believe that the Commonwealth would have priority over anyone else in terms of trying to claw these

Speaker 1: 
09:23-09:25
trying to claw these back.

Speaker 1: 
09:25-09:26
What do you think?

Speaker 1: 
09:26-09:28
Ah, Sally, tax.

Speaker 3: 
09:28-09:29
You reckon?

Speaker 1: 
09:29-09:32
You reckon the tax man's coming in first?

Speaker 1: 
09:33-09:33
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
09:34-09:35
Nicole, what do you reckon?

Speaker 1: 
09:37-09:38
With the bags?

Speaker 1: 
09:45-09:47
Nicholas, you're going to stand right behind there.

Speaker 1: 
09:47-09:54
Who's going to turn up there and ask for their for their fortified chocolate milk first?

Speaker 1: 
09:54-09:55
We'll run through this.

Speaker 1: 
09:55-10:01
Now the idea here is, so for example, yes.

Speaker 1: 
10:01-10:03
So let's do this.

Speaker 1: 
10:03-10:05
We've got let's look at the stakeholders.

Speaker 1: 
10:05-10:08
And of course, we wish the best for everyone invol

Speaker 1: 
10:08-10:09
We've got staff.

Speaker 1: 
10:09-10:11
Who else do we have?

Speaker 1: 
10:15-10:16
Customers, yes.

Speaker 1: 
10:16-10:21
So we would have that would be in the form of their clients, in the form of their members.

Speaker 1: 
10:21-10:22
Who else do we have?

Speaker 1: 
10:23-10:30
Creditors, secured and unsecured creditors.

Speaker 1: 
10:30-10:35
They may come in the form of suppliers, landlords

Speaker 1: 
10:35-10:38
Power Amenities, fantastic.

Speaker 1: 
10:40-10:41
Right?

Speaker 1: 
10:42-10:46
We strip that back now to talk about how it is that folks enter into agreements.

Speaker 1: 
10:46-10:53
Now if we take this example and other examples to come, why is it important to determine whether or not there's a contract?

Speaker 1: 
10:54-10:55
This is wonderful.

Speaker 1: 
10:55-10:56
Thank you.

Speaker 1: 
10:56-10:58
Again, keep these examples coming.

Speaker 1: 
10:58-11:02
Why is it important to determine whether or not there's a contract?

Speaker 1: 
11:02-11:04
The status of the contract

Speaker 1: 
11:04-11:05
the terms of the contract.

Speaker 1: 
11:05-11:08
Rights and obligations, yes, yes, yes.

Speaker 1: 
11:08-11:11
Let's delve a little bit deeper.

Speaker 1: 
11:11-11:17
Remedies, very good, to determine what rights and obligations there are

Speaker 1: 
11:16-11:19
how we can look towards remedies.

Speaker 1: 
11:19-11:20
What else?

Speaker 1: 
11:24-11:26
In terms of clawing back any funds?

Speaker 1: 
11:32-11:39
Do you believe that the nature of the contract may also be indicated or indicative of whether or not someone's a secured or an unsecured creditor?

Speaker 1: 
11:43-11:44
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
11:45-11:47
The contract does have value, Quay, and that's very important.

Speaker 1: 
11:48-11:52
It could be that the contract is actually unsold or the debt is on sold.

Speaker 1: 
11:53-11:56
So we look at the formation.

Speaker 1: 
11:57-12:00
And here specifically, we're looking at the sale of goods.

Speaker 1: 
12:00-12:05
And what we're saying is that the goods are moving.

Speaker 1: 
12:09-12:13
There have been postulated links indeed, Montana, yeah, criminal conduct.

Speaker 1: 
12:16-12:21
So sorry, go ahead.

Speaker 2: 
12:21-12:23
Sorry, I've just got the print in the background.

Speaker 2: 
12:23-12:24
Sorry.

Speaker 1: 
12:24-12:28
Okay, you're just printing out those Swinburne Online notes.

Speaker 2: 
12:29-12:30
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
12:31-12:32
Go ahead.

Speaker 1: 
12:37-12:39
A pregnant pause, folks.

Speaker 1: 
12:39-12:42
That is what we call a pregnant pause.

Speaker 1: 
12:42-12:44
So, a sale of good contracts

Speaker 1: 
12:44-12:46
the seller transfers.

Speaker 1: 
12:46-12:50
Can you look at the litter bi the latter bit or the middle bit or agrees?

Speaker 1: 
12:50-12:51
Or agrees.

Speaker 1: 
12:52-12:53
Or agrees.

Speaker 1: 
12:54-12:56
Or agrees.

Speaker 1: 
12:57-13:01
I'm going to keep on repeating this until you tell me what this is.

Speaker 1: 
13:01-13:03
Or agrees.

Speaker 1: 
13:03-13:06
When you are agreeing, what are you doing?

Speaker 1: 
13:07-13:10
Or agrees to transfer.

Speaker 1: 
13:18-13:18
Tacit.

Speaker 1: 
13:19-13:20
Oh, Sally.

Speaker 1: 
13:20-13:21
What do you reckon?

Speaker 1: 
13:22-13:27
Tacit or actually quite

Speaker 1: 
13:28-13:30
More than tacit.

Speaker 1: 
13:30-13:34
You're consenting, you're promising, you're enabling, you're creating.

Speaker 1: 
13:34-13:36
Very good, very good.

Speaker 1: 
13:36-13:39
So the first portion is that it's actually happening.

Speaker 1: 
13:40-13:42
Second is that there's an agreement for it to happen.

Speaker 1: 
13:43-13:43
Okay?

Speaker 1: 
13:44-13:50
Which means that and remember that our session here is to quench your thirst for learning

Speaker 1: 
13:50-14:00
not to reteach and not to teach just to pass assessments, to quench your learn for to quench your thirst for learning and to do it in a practical sense

Speaker 1: 
14:00-14:08
So could it well be that a contract has been formed on the basis of an agreement to transfer something?

Speaker 1: 
14:18-14:20
Yes, it is possible.

Speaker 1: 
14:20-14:22
You got that, folks?

Speaker 1: 
14:24-14:26
Lovely.

Speaker 1: 
14:26-14:33
The ordinary elements in the sale of goods it needs more the right.

Speaker 1: 
14:34-14:36
Well, let's see what it means.

Speaker 1: 
14:37-14:47
You need the goods, you need the money consideration, and you need the transfer of property.

Speaker 1: 
14:50-14:58
So the formation of the contract to sell the goods and the contract is completed

Speaker 1: 
14:59-15:04
when the goods for consideration and transfers occurred.

Speaker 1: 
15:05-15:11
Could there be some value to an agreement prior to

Speaker 1: 
15:11-15:13
All of these elements.

Speaker 1: 
15:19-15:23
So, could it be that someone could take

Speaker 1: 
15:24-15:28
Orders, yes, an agreement to sell.

Speaker 1: 
15:28-15:34
And what and if your mics are working, I understand you may be in various states of

Speaker 1: 
15:33-15:35
Repair, disrepair, crowd, numb, crowd.

Speaker 1: 
15:35-15:38
But if your mics are working, feel free to jump on them.

Speaker 1: 
15:40-15:42
What would you do with an agreement to sell?

Speaker 1: 
15:42-15:46
Why would that have some sort of legal basis, do you think?

Speaker 1: 
15:47-15:49
Why may it be protected?

Speaker 1: 
15:57-16:00
Is there some financial value to it?

Speaker 1: 
16:03-16:04
Yeah, Nicola, yeah.

Speaker 1: 
16:04-16:06
Sets expectations.

Speaker 1: 
16:07-16:09
Manufacturing of goods, yes, that's very good.

Speaker 1: 
16:10-16:12
That imposes a liability as well.

Speaker 1: 
16:12-16:16
What do you think you could do with the expectations of goods that were ordered?

Speaker 1: 
16:18-16:25
Could you secure, perhaps, finance on the basis of goods that have been ordered?

Speaker 1: 
16:29-16:30
Well done, folks.

Speaker 1: 
16:30-16:31
Very good.

Speaker 1: 
16:31-16:33
Very practical responses.

Speaker 1: 
16:34-16:35
Well done.

Speaker 1: 
16:35-16:39
And that's why we protect these things

Speaker 1: 
16:39-16:46
So we can have existing goods, future goods, specific goods and unascertained goods.

Speaker 1: 
16:47-16:53
Existing goods, as the name suggests, future goods to be manufactured.

Speaker 1: 
16:53-17:01
or acquired by the seller, please look at this, acquired by the seller after the making of the contract for sale.

Speaker 1: 
17:01-17:04
Now why would that affect the remedy?

Speaker 1: 
17:04-17:08
You mentioned the remedy there, Sally, and folks jump on in.

Speaker 1: 
17:09-17:15
Why would that affect the remedy if you say that there's a breach of goods regarding future contract?

Speaker 4: 
17:15-17:28
Therefore, I have been harmed because I was just reading through the notes that if you haven't actually taken delivery, it's not

Speaker 4: 
17:28-17:29
it's not considered salient.

Speaker 4: 
17:29-17:35
So you have a different remedy available if it's a future delivery.

Speaker 4: 
17:36-17:38
So it falls under agreement.

Speaker 4: 
17:38-17:39
So your rights are different.

Speaker 1: 
17:40-17:42
What have you done?

Speaker 1: 
17:42-17:43
What has happened?

Speaker 1: 
17:45-17:46
A bridge.

Speaker 1: 
17:48-17:49
Yeah?

Speaker 1: 
17:50-17:51
A breach of a contract.

Speaker 4: 
17:52-17:54
Yes, so a breach of a contract.

Speaker 4: 
17:54-17:56
So if it's an agreement.

Speaker 4: 
17:56-18:08
to sell as opposed as the delivery has not actually taken place, then which is when it was supposed to actually

Speaker 4: 
18:08-18:18
be accepted when it was actually accepted by the the buyer when you have different

Speaker 4: 
18:17-18:25
remedies open to you if something was perhaps well, I guess if they're not delivered.

Speaker 4: 
18:26-18:27
I'm guessing.

Speaker 4: 
18:27-18:27
I don't know.

Speaker 4: 
18:27-18:29
I'm still willing.

Speaker 1: 
18:29-18:32
And what would the basis of the claim be in that instance in future?

Speaker 4: 
18:33-18:37
Well, non-delivery, I would say.

Speaker 1: 
18:37-18:42
Yes, non delivery, and because of that non delivery, what's happened?

Speaker 1: 
18:44-18:47
What am I going to do with four hundred thousand wigs?

Speaker 1: 
18:48-18:51
I mean, I can tell you what I'd do with three of them.

Speaker 4: 
18:53-18:56
Well, wouldn't it depend on if you were the buyer or the seller?

Speaker 4: 
18:56-18:59
The seller will have one issue if it was the non delivery

Speaker 4: 
18:59-19:06
Of a breach of contract, and a buyer will have a different issue for non-delivery of a breach of contract under a breach of contract.

Speaker 1: 
19:07-19:09
So there could be financial implications.

Speaker 1: 
19:11-19:14
Causing damage to the other party to the contract, yes.

Speaker 1: 
19:14-19:23
So if you get a situation whereby I usually say in these instances, identify what the goods are and track the goods

Speaker 1: 
19:22-19:35
They start here, they go there, the liability moves from here to there, they go to a distributor, the liability of the distributor, if there is liability to the distributor

Speaker 1: 
19:34-19:36
Then they go here, right?

Speaker 1: 
19:36-19:39
So you almost sort of GPS them.

Speaker 1: 
19:39-19:44
Specific goods are identified and agreed upon at the time of contract of a sale is made.

Speaker 1: 
19:45-19:47
Now what would a specific good be?

Speaker 1: 
19:51-19:53
There is inconvenience, definitely.

Speaker 1: 
19:53-19:55
What would a specific would be?

Speaker 5: 
19:58-20:04
Just the goods to be transferred, the goods that are being bought, like the actual thing that's being exchanged?

Speaker 1: 
20:05-20:05
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
20:06-20:11
So I'm buying twenty pianos because I'm an octopus.

Speaker 1: 
20:12-20:15
As opposed to that actual item.

Speaker 1: 
20:15-20:16
Very good.

Speaker 1: 
20:16-20:17
This piano.

Speaker 1: 
20:17-20:18
This one.

Speaker 1: 
20:18-20:19
This one.

Speaker 1: 
20:19-20:23
This Steinway with a lovely tail.

Speaker 1: 
20:27-20:35
Kwe, I could tell you a quite lengthy story about my fight with Kvart, where I posted on their

Speaker 1: 
20:35-20:45
on their Facebook page that Kmart cancelled Christmas because they failed to deliver the Christmas gifts

Speaker 1: 
20:45-20:48
I could tell you that story, and I have in part.

Speaker 1: 
20:49-20:51
Well, no, no, no, it wasn't menacing.

Speaker 1: 
20:51-20:56
I I did it with a sort of a hue of empathy

Speaker 1: 
20:56-20:58
Um but uh yes, yes.

Speaker 1: 
20:59-21:06
I said there's no need for the Grinch and uh um uh oh, it was uh oh

Speaker 1: 
21:05-21:07
Sorry, I'm being triggered.

Speaker 1: 
21:07-21:18
But specific goods are instead of saying I'll have ten pianos, I'll have ten pianos, and these are the specific ones I want.

Speaker 1: 
21:19-21:20
Okay.

Speaker 1: 
21:23-21:25
Yeah, I know, Sally.

Speaker 1: 
21:25-21:26
I became one of those people.

Speaker 1: 
21:29-21:34
unascertained goods are sold under description when no particular goods are identified.

Speaker 1: 
21:34-21:35
Okay.

Speaker 1: 
21:35-21:38
You suggest that

Speaker 1: 
21:38-21:42
These are the types of goods that we want.

Speaker 1: 
21:42-21:48
We want ten tennis rackets, and thank you very much.

Speaker 1: 
21:48-21:50
Are you getting a sense of the differences?

Speaker 1: 
21:50-21:56
And the differences, of course, bring with them implications.

Speaker 1: 
21:59-22:02
Sally, these also are the type of people that fill out evaluations.

Speaker 1: 
22:03-22:09
So sometimes we love them and sometimes we think, oh dear, now

Speaker 1: 
22:09-22:10
what happened to you.

Speaker 1: 
22:11-22:17
So let's look at end of semester, which basically means whatever happens, it's my f

Speaker 1: 
22:18-22:19
Now, terms of a contract.

Speaker 1: 
22:20-22:22
Let's have a look at terms of a contract.

Speaker 1: 
22:22-22:25
Why would we need to focus on these things?

Speaker 1: 
22:26-22:28
Why would we need to focus on these things

Speaker 1: 
22:28-22:31
We talked last week about the importance of agreements.

Speaker 1: 
22:32-22:34
We talked about the nature of regulation.

Speaker 1: 
22:34-22:41
We talked about the idea that regulation and agreements allow for confidence, allow for commerce.

Speaker 1: 
22:45-22:53
Because some of these may be implied, some of these may not be able to be backed out of, some of them may be expressed.

Speaker 1: 
22:53-22:56
Some of them influence the type of remedy.

Speaker 1: 
22:57-22:57
Very good.

Speaker 1: 
22:57-22:59
They set out expectations.

Speaker 1: 
22:59-23:01
They set out protections.

Speaker 1: 
23:01-23:01
Fantastic.

Speaker 1: 
23:01-23:04
Folks, make a list of these things

Speaker 1: 
23:04-23:17
These are the things that are going to drive your thinking when you are responding to questions or when you're thinking about the practical elements of a subject like this as opposed to just remembering that you go to section four of how's it going.

Speaker 1: 
23:19-23:20
So a condition.

Speaker 1: 
23:20-23:22
A condition is an essential term.

Speaker 1: 
23:23-23:25
So what happens when you breach essential?

Speaker 1: 
23:25-23:26
Essence.

Speaker 1: 
23:26-23:27
Essence.

Speaker 1: 
23:27-23:31
Not only a shampoo, but a condition is essential.

Speaker 1: 
23:31-23:33
Without it,

Speaker 1: 
23:32-23:37
Have you heard of the song I can't live if living is without you?

Speaker 1: 
23:38-23:42
Without this condition, what happens to the contract?

Speaker 1: 
23:45-23:47
And now I get very excited.

Speaker 1: 
23:49-23:52
Rescind, recind.

Speaker 1: 
23:54-24:02
What happens rescission The contract itself

Speaker 1: 
24:03-24:13
It allows the party to say that they no longer want to be part and will not be part of this contract.

Speaker 1: 
24:14-24:18
and allows them to seek damages.

Speaker 1: 
24:19-24:20
A warranty.

Speaker 1: 
24:20-24:25
So if we were sort of building who would the top dog be?

Speaker 1: 
24:26-24:27
Jada, yes.

Speaker 1: 
24:27-24:37
The idea for damages is to return the the party to the position, the damaged party

Speaker 1: 
24:38-24:43
Okay, to the position I were in before the contract.

Speaker 1: 
24:43-24:48
So condition up the top, warranty, lesser importance

Speaker 1: 
24:49-24:52
merely gives rise to the claim of damages, which means that what?

Speaker 3: 
24:53-24:57
What does a warranty what is the difference between the condition and the warranty?

Speaker 3: 
25:15-25:17
You can claim for damages for warranty.

Speaker 1: 
25:18-25:21
What you're unable to do, perhaps, is rescind the contract.

Speaker 1: 
25:24-25:25
See the difference there?

Speaker 1: 
25:27-25:34
And the New South Wales Act looks at intermediate stipulation, which is neither a condition nor a warranty, but it's just saying listen

Speaker 1: 
25:34-25:47
The breach of this stipulation, the breach of this, constitutes the type of behavior

Speaker 1: 
25:48-25:53
That means that one of the parties is saying that this contract is no longer on foot.

Speaker 1: 
25:58-26:02
So when you repudiate a contract, what are you doing?

Speaker 1: 
26:02-26:05
When a contract is repudiated, what is happening?

Speaker 1: 
26:15-26:18
What is happening is through your behaviour.

Speaker 1: 
26:20-26:32
You are saying that this behavior is indicative of the type of conduct that shows that this contract isn't happening.

Speaker 1: 
26:35-26:41
I wouldn't say necessarily the validity of it, because there may still be a valid contract.

Speaker 1: 
26:49-26:52
And then we get to our legislation.

Speaker 1: 
26:53-27:03
So remember here that we will be applying general law terms and contractual terms sorry, and legislative terms

Speaker 1: 
27:03-27:13
Which therefore means that you must be aware of the hierarchy in terms of how these two interface.

Speaker 1: 
27:14-27:25
that the legislative the legislative provisions are those that would be superior

Speaker 1: 
27:25-27:30
to the common law provisions or the common law terms.

Speaker 1: 
27:30-27:34
Contract repudiation is someone shows here, their behavior shows that they're repudiating.

Speaker 1: 
27:35-27:38
They're going, yeah, look now, whatever, whatever's on there, but look at my conduct.

Speaker 1: 
27:39-27:39
Right.

Speaker 1: 
27:39-27:48
And the other party says, well, you're saying all the right things, but what you're actually doing is sort of just

Speaker 1: 
27:47-27:54
the type of conduct that is indicative of an individual that is not willing to go forward with this.

Speaker 1: 
27:54-27:57
Is everyone sort of getting a sense of those things?

Speaker 1: 
27:58-28:02
Please let me know if you've got any queries or questions.

Speaker 4: 
28:04-28:09
Are you saying it's like a charact it's showing someone's character?

Speaker 4: 
28:10-28:12
Or it's

Speaker 1: 
28:13-28:23
Well, it may be de facto showing someone's character in that what they're doing by way of contract repudiation is being a bit sneaky, sneaky or dishonest

Speaker 1: 
28:22-28:31
But what it is, is actually they're repudiating the contract because of the fact that they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing

Speaker 1: 
28:32-28:33
Does that help?

Speaker 4: 
28:33-28:36
Yes, so it's less character, more their actions.

Speaker 1: 
28:37-28:38
Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1: 
28:38-28:41
They might be a really nice person, but

Speaker 1: 
28:41-28:50
The fact of the matter is that this contract needs to be fulfilled by doing or not doing A, B, C and D.

Speaker 1: 
28:51-29:04
And the party's absence of doing something, or the fact that they have or have not done something, is not fulfilling the contract and it's repudiating the contract.

Speaker 1: 
29:08-29:15
So the Sale of Goods Act here in Victoria

Speaker 1: 
29:15-29:22
implies certain terms in all contracts for sale unless the circumstances of the contract show a different intention.

Speaker 1: 
29:23-29:27
Now what do we mean by implies certain terms?

Speaker 1: 
29:29-29:30
Through implication.

Speaker 1: 
29:41-29:42
That's right.

Speaker 1: 
29:42-29:44
Terms are included.

Speaker 1: 
29:45-29:45
Yep.

Speaker 1: 
29:45-29:48
They're included even if they're not written into the contract.

Speaker 1: 
29:49-29:53
So someone might say, for example, oh, but that's not in the contract.

Speaker 1: 
29:54-29:56
They're implied terms.

Speaker 1: 
29:58-30:02
Now what is the implication imported into?

Speaker 1: 
30:02-30:04
Why by implication?

Speaker 1: 
30:04-30:07
Let's think about this practically.

Speaker 1: 
30:07-30:09
Why by implication?

Speaker 1: 
30:11-30:13
So let's look at another example.

Speaker 1: 
30:14-30:16
I tried to lean on something and I missed it.

Speaker 1: 
30:16-30:18
Hang on, let me try and be cool again.

Speaker 1: 
30:20-30:22
Let's look at an employment contract

Speaker 1: 
30:23-30:25
Okay, are you all with me out there?

Speaker 1: 
30:25-30:26
Can I get a hello?

Speaker 1: 
30:26-30:28
I wasn't going to do the other thing.

Speaker 6: 
30:28-30:28
Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1: 
30:29-30:30
Yes, you're with me.

Speaker 1: 
30:30-30:30
Good.

Speaker 1: 
30:30-30:31
Lovely to see you.

Speaker 1: 
30:31-30:32
Thank you very much

Speaker 1: 
30:32-30:34
Now, good, good, good, good, good.

Speaker 1: 
30:35-30:36
Now, let's look at this.

Speaker 1: 
30:37-30:41
If you're going to have a fruitful

Speaker 1: 
30:41-30:55
and respectful employment situation, it is implied that you will also have what kind of behaviors encapsulated within that employment relations

Speaker 1: 
30:55-30:57
What kind of behaviors are implied?

Speaker 5: 
30:59-31:04
Well, you could be respectful to your peers, that you won't steal from your employer.

Speaker 1: 
31:05-31:08
that you'll be professional, that you'll be ethical.

Speaker 1: 
31:08-31:17
Some of these are legal, some of these are not legal, that you will not engage in misconduct, that you will be compliant with.

Speaker 1: 
31:19-31:27
policy that forms part of your contract and otherwise, that you will keep confidential information.

Speaker 1: 
31:27-31:29
Do you see the implications?

Speaker 1: 
31:29-31:34
Without this, you cannot have a fruitful relationship.

Speaker 1: 
31:36-31:44
If we take those principles and we apply it with regards to the sale of goods, in order for there to be

Speaker 1: 
31:43-31:45
Yeah, they pay.

Speaker 1: 
31:45-31:45
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
31:46-31:49
Oh, don't get me, don't get me started, Junco.

Speaker 1: 
31:50-31:52
In order for

Speaker 1: 
31:52-32:02
there to be a fruitful relationship between parties involved in the sale of goods

Speaker 1: 
32:02-32:11
By implication, what must there also be in addition to all the statutory provisions?

Speaker 4: 
32:12-32:13
Can you say that again?

Speaker 1: 
32:14-32:14
I will.

Speaker 1: 
32:15-32:22
In order to have a fruitful, important

Speaker 1: 
32:22-32:34
relationship with regards to the sale of goods, it is implied that there must also be what kind of things?

Speaker 1: 
32:35-32:36
Money exchange?

Speaker 1: 
32:37-32:39
Yes, or consideration?

Speaker 1: 
32:40-32:41
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
32:42-32:43
If there is a contract.

Speaker 1: 
32:43-32:44
What other things?

Speaker 1: 
32:47-32:48
Keep going.

Speaker 1: 
32:48-32:49
What other things?

Speaker 1: 
32:50-32:55
If I'm selling you um a hairbrush

Speaker 1: 
32:55-32:57
I'm obsessed with wigs and hairbrushes.

Speaker 1: 
32:57-33:00
I guess that's indicating my regular Saturday night.

Speaker 1: 
33:00-33:02
Go ahead, Suswati.

Speaker 7: 
33:05-33:06
Hi, Nicholas.

Speaker 7: 
33:06-33:09
I would like to know, like, is it like the work cover as well?

Speaker 7: 
33:09-33:16
Like, if an employee gets injured, so it's implied they will be covered by the work cover?

Speaker 1: 
33:16-33:24
Well, yes, in a sense, but what we're doing now is taking that approach, yeah, and we're moving it towards the sale of goods.

Speaker 1: 
33:24-33:31
So if you take that line of thinking, very good, and you say to yourself, okay,

Speaker 1: 
33:30-33:32
What is by implication?

Speaker 1: 
33:32-33:35
When we're selling goods, we're selling one thing to the other.

Speaker 1: 
33:35-33:41
So do we need to have in the contract that the goods must be fit for purpose?

Speaker 1: 
33:41-33:46
Or is that an implication of the types of agreements that we enter into?

Speaker 1: 
33:49-33:54
Are folks getting a sense of I know I'm banging on about this, but this is usually

Speaker 1: 
33:54-34:05
where the most area of confusion occurs, in addition to these terms, maybe indicated through statute, yes, but they are also implied

Speaker 1: 
34:05-34:08
So, a lot of times people might say, Well, it's not in the contract.

Speaker 1: 
34:09-34:12
And you say, Yes, but it's an implied term.

Speaker 1: 
34:13-34:15
Because without this term,

Speaker 1: 
34:15-34:21
Why would you enter into an agreement to buy something that is not of merchantable quality?

Speaker 1: 
34:21-34:25
Why would you enter into an agreement to buy something that is not fit for purpose?

Speaker 1: 
34:26-34:31
Please let me know if that's not making sense or if that is making sense.

Speaker 4: 
34:34-34:48
Can I say my understanding is that the consumer guarantees in law that fit within various obviously statutes, whether it be state or federal, which work together, basically have

Speaker 4: 
34:48-35:00
basic fundamental guarantees or ideas of what you expect when you are getting goods or services, when you're transacting to basically create harmony or fairness

Speaker 4: 
35:00-35:10
And therefore, they are they're basically a fundamental set that can't be waved away by a small print.

Speaker 1: 
35:10-35:14
Yes, and Sally, thank you.

Speaker 1: 
35:15-35:16
It also depends on when they apply.

Speaker 1: 
35:17-35:19
So they may apply at particular

Speaker 1: 
35:19-35:21
stages of the supply chain.

Speaker 1: 
35:21-35:32
Now that some of those regulations that you're discussing about and consumer guarantees may be more applicable to the end consumer rather than

Speaker 1: 
35:32-35:38
the earliest stages of the supply chain, which might be the procurement of the goods.

Speaker 1: 
35:38-35:39
Okay.

Speaker 1: 
35:39-35:45
So the ACL, for example, may be more tailored towards various elements of the ACL

Speaker 1: 
35:44-35:56
maybe tailored to the person who buys the television from wherever it is that one buys the television, as opposed to the person who buys the semiconductors

Speaker 1: 
35:56-36:01
from the factory that makes the semiconductors that goes into the television.

Speaker 1: 
36:04-36:05
What have I done there?

Speaker 1: 
36:09-36:14
Russell, it's not implied beyond, it's within.

Speaker 1: 
36:14-36:15
It's within.

Speaker 1: 
36:19-36:24
You cannot contract out of particular terms, as Sally said.

Speaker 1: 
36:25-36:31
So for example, you could not suggest that we're entering into a contract

Speaker 1: 
36:30-36:38
or you enter into a contract whereby, for example, the goods were not of fit for purpose.

Speaker 1: 
36:44-36:53
You can contract out of some of implied terms, but there are also some non delegable duties that you cannot delegate out of.

Speaker 1: 
36:54-36:55
You can't move them aside.

Speaker 1: 
37:05-37:09
Those aren't those imported by statute.

Speaker 1: 
37:13-37:22
There are some conditions that are able to be shaped that are in statute, but they would not be the core fundamental ones.

Speaker 1: 
37:25-37:29
So when we're looking at transfer of property, we need to think of the following.

Speaker 1: 
37:30-37:32
We need to think of follow the property.

Speaker 1: 
37:32-37:36
We need to think of property that is in possession.

Speaker 1: 
37:37-37:42
We need to think of property in and possession of goods.

Speaker 1: 
37:42-37:47
We need to think of whether possession amounts to

Speaker 1: 
37:48-37:51
Ownership.

Speaker 1: 
37:51-37:54
So you would say, who's got the property?

Speaker 1: 
37:55-37:56
Where is it supposed to go?

Speaker 1: 
37:58-38:00
What's governing that in the agreement?

Speaker 1: 
38:01-38:03
Who's got possession?

Speaker 1: 
38:04-38:06
What rights do they have?

Speaker 1: 
38:07-38:09
Point number two

Speaker 1: 
38:09-38:16
What rules do we have in this agreement, in this legislation, in the common law, regarding the transfer?

Speaker 1: 
38:18-38:25
So if I give this property to the delivery person, have I transferred ownership?

Speaker 1: 
38:26-38:31
The right of the seller to defer transfer of the property and risk of loss

Speaker 1: 
38:36-38:38
So let's have a look.

Speaker 1: 
38:43-38:49
So one person may have the possession of certain goods, while another person may have property in those goods.

Speaker 1: 
38:49-38:51
What do you think that this means?

Speaker 1: 
38:52-38:53
What does this mean?

Speaker 1: 
38:57-38:58
Property and possession.

Speaker 1: 
38:58-39:01
Are you seeing the distinction that we're making here?

Speaker 1: 
39:08-39:15
So when we're talking yeah, when we're talking about the property, we're talking about ownership

Speaker 1: 
39:15-39:16
or title, yeah.

Speaker 1: 
39:16-39:19
And the possession may be custody or control.

Speaker 1: 
39:19-39:26
So for example, a bailment is a possessory interest

Speaker 1: 
39:26-39:31
So A leaves their car with B for repair.

Speaker 1: 
39:31-39:36
Oh, these A and B get in all sorts of trouble in la in law school, don't they

Speaker 1: 
39:37-39:39
A leaves her car with B for repair.

Speaker 1: 
39:40-39:46
The ownership of the car is with A, but the possession is with B.

Speaker 1: 
39:46-39:56
And therefore we ask the question, does and do these states of ownership and possession

Speaker 1: 
39:55-39:59
bring with them rights and obligations for the parties who have them.

Speaker 1: 
40:00-40:01
So you may hear over the journey.

Speaker 1: 
40:02-40:08
And when you get into this wonderful area of law called property law, and I hope you've all had a chance to dance

Speaker 1: 
40:08-40:14
In the wonderful tulips of property law, we will often talk about property and possession and all sorts of things.

Speaker 1: 
40:14-40:20
So here we may say that, listen, whilst the repairer has the car

Speaker 1: 
40:21-40:28
They have particular types of interests, but they do not do away with the ownership interests.

Speaker 1: 
40:28-40:35
So ownership of specific or ascertained goods passes when parties intend it to pass.

Speaker 1: 
40:35-40:37
Yes, go ahead, Monte.

Speaker 2: 
40:37-40:38
Yes.

Speaker 2: 
40:38-40:40
So with respect to you mentioned cars, right?

Speaker 2: 
40:40-40:45
So say for instance, like are you referring to like a sales lien or whatever it's called, like sales lien?

Speaker 2: 
40:46-40:47
How do you say it?

Speaker 2: 
40:47-40:48
I don't want to butcher the word

Speaker 2: 
40:49-40:58
So for instance, okay, I'll exp first okay, so say for instance, a um a panel beater, okay, is repairing a car and then the

Speaker 2: 
40:58-41:04
the customer doesn't have the funds to pay the panel leader or the the director.

Speaker 2: 
41:05-41:10
So from my understanding, the panel leader can keep that car

Speaker 2: 
41:11-41:12
What's the word?

Speaker 2: 
41:12-41:12
Lean?

Speaker 2: 
41:12-41:13
Lean.

Speaker 2: 
41:13-41:13
Yeah.

Speaker 2: 
41:14-41:15
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
41:15-41:17
Is that what we're referring to?

Speaker 1: 
41:17-41:18
That could be an example.

Speaker 1: 
41:18-41:19
That's an equitable right.

Speaker 2: 
41:21-41:21
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
41:22-41:22
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
41:22-41:23
Yeah, that's an example.

Speaker 1: 
41:24-41:24
Good.

Speaker 2: 
41:24-41:28
Like conf like a conferred power, like with delta.

Speaker 1: 
41:36-41:40
I mean, it may be in the literature as such, but I'm just thinking about it practically.

Speaker 1: 
41:41-41:45
Conferred or I mean

Speaker 1: 
41:45-41:50
If you said you're thinking about words, it's because I like to give words sort of a practical sense.

Speaker 1: 
41:50-41:53
It is a right.

Speaker 1: 
41:54-41:59
When I say power, I don't want to stay just on power because it could also be an obligation as well.

Speaker 2: 
42:17-42:24
When I say sorry, um Nick, when I say um like so, for instance, like ARPA, so I don't know if like I think Podiatri is also under ARPA.

Speaker 1: 
42:24-42:26
So we are, yes.

Speaker 2: 
42:26-42:28
Yes, so it's an uh um

Speaker 2: 
42:28-42:38
So whilst that might not be specifically in the statutes, we've also got other obligations as practitioners to

Speaker 2: 
42:38-42:40
be bound by certain ethical obligations.

Speaker 2: 
42:41-42:41
I don't know.

Speaker 2: 
42:41-42:42
I'm just yeah, a bit confused.

Speaker 1: 
42:43-42:46
Yeah, we've got fiduciary duties, we've got layers of law, yes.

Speaker 1: 
42:46-42:48
There are there are

Speaker 1: 
42:48-42:56
So if we take that and we sort of expand it, if I may, Montana, what Montana is referring to is the Australian Health Practitioners Regulation Agency

Speaker 1: 
42:56-43:07
And suggesting that there's an overarching regulatory framework that determines how it is that particular people do what they do, we're bound by that framewor

Speaker 1: 
43:07-43:15
Similarly, we have the ACL, which determines how stakeholders that are bound by this framework do what they particularly do.

Speaker 1: 
43:15-43:18
Guidance, therefore, is provided by those regulations.

Speaker 1: 
43:18-43:20
Guidance is provided by those rules.

Speaker 1: 
43:21-43:24
It's also provided by general law.

Speaker 1: 
43:24-43:35
And within that are legal obligations and rights that are by way of obliga by way of implication

Speaker 1: 
43:34-43:37
And that are expressed in nature.

Speaker 1: 
43:37-43:38
Does that help?

Speaker 1: 
43:44-43:46
So look at the two basic rules.

Speaker 1: 
43:46-43:53
Specific or ascertained goods pass when parties intended to pass

Speaker 1: 
43:52-44:02
taking into account the terms of the contract, the conduct and the circumstances, and ownership of

Speaker 1: 
44:01-44:06
unascertained goods or future goods cannot pass until the goods become ascertained.

Speaker 1: 
44:06-44:07
Why?

Speaker 1: 
44:09-44:13
By the way, Montana, my thoracic outlet syndrome's giving me grief.

Speaker 1: 
44:19-44:23
I think I need to go and do something other than sit.

Speaker 1: 
44:23-44:28
Why do you think that ownership of unascertained or future goods

Speaker 1: 
44:28-44:31
Cannot pass until the goods have become ascertained.

Speaker 1: 
44:36-44:38
What do you do when you have ownership?

Speaker 1: 
44:42-44:43
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
44:46-44:49
And have you heard the song I Who Have Nothing?

Speaker 1: 
44:49-44:54
If you have nothing, how can you have ownership of nothing?

Speaker 1: 
44:54-44:57
So they must come into fruition.

Speaker 1: 
44:57-44:59
They must come to fruition.

Speaker 1: 
45:03-45:07
So if you're having a problem to analyze, you think of yourself, okay, what are these goods?

Speaker 1: 
45:08-45:08
Are they specific?

Speaker 1: 
45:08-45:10
Are they ascertained?

Speaker 1: 
45:12-45:14
Where is the property?

Speaker 1: 
45:15-45:21
Is it does the person who has the property also have possession of the goods?

Speaker 1: 
45:25-45:26
Is this a condition?

Speaker 1: 
45:26-45:28
Is it a warranty?

Speaker 1: 
45:34-45:36
Now, the Romalberg clauses.

Speaker 1: 
45:37-45:39
So let's look at this in a practical sense.

Speaker 1: 
45:42-45:53
The title retention of title means that the ownership, okay, the legal ownership

Speaker 1: 
45:54-46:00
And clauses are terms.

Speaker 1: 
46:01-46:05
So a term regarding the retention of title

Speaker 1: 
46:06-46:19
enables I'll come to that in a minute, Sally enables the person who is selling to recover the goods in the event that there is an insolvency

Speaker 1: 
46:19-46:29
and therefore prevent the goods from becoming part of the assets that may be distributed to creditors.

Speaker 1: 
46:32-46:38
Now, what do you think retention of title I'll come to your question in a tech.

Speaker 1: 
46:39-46:41
What do you think that retention of title clauses do?

Speaker 1: 
46:42-46:43
What do they seek to do?

Speaker 5: 
46:47-46:53
give somebody the le the the the legal ownership of something rather than maybe the the control of it?

Speaker 1: 
46:54-46:54
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
46:54-46:56
And why is that important?

Speaker 1: 
46:56-46:58
So Nicholas says retain the title until the price is paid.

Speaker 1: 
46:59-46:59
Why is that important?

Speaker 5: 
47:00-47:03
It might be intellectual property that might need to retain the title of.

Speaker 5: 
47:03-47:05
So it still means something like

Speaker 5: 
47:05-47:12
In terms of have value after that person's used it, or maybe it's under a rental agreement, or there might be numerous in a situations like that.

Speaker 1: 
47:13-47:21
Here's some old we're talking about rental agreement really wouldn't be subject to this because we're talking about sale of goods per se.

Speaker 5: 
47:21-47:24
But can you have a like a rent to buy scenario?

Speaker 5: 
47:25-47:33
So where you've you've you've basically got a contract that says after twelve payments, you own the goods, but until that time, the title still belongs to the person that sold to you?

Speaker 1: 
47:35-47:39
I would

Speaker 1: 
47:40-47:41
Like a shuttle mortgage?

Speaker 1: 
47:42-47:43
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
47:43-47:50
Yeah, I would probably put that down to a shuttle mortgage, yeah, which is another word that we had to sort of wait until someone else prevents

Speaker 1: 
47:50-47:56
pronounced it before we did because you'd get chattel, chatel, but chattel.

Speaker 1: 
47:56-47:57
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
47:57-47:59
So I'll just come to some of the questions.

Speaker 1: 
48:00-48:01
Just hang on a sec

Speaker 1: 
48:01-48:04
The retention of title clauses enable the seller to recover the goods.

Speaker 1: 
48:04-48:12
This also allows for people to purchase goods and also for there to be confidence by the seller.

Speaker 1: 
48:12-48:20
So for example, that the seller says, look, I do have some legal protection and this will not form part of the distributed

Speaker 1: 
48:21-48:33
the property to be distributed upon bankruptcy because what may happen is that the person who provides the goods may end up in a queue with a whole bunch of other people waiting to get whatever it is that they've gotten.

Speaker 1: 
48:34-48:43
So Sally says, doesn't the free delivery under FOB rules determine when the buyer became in possession?

Speaker 1: 
48:47-48:49
Just give me a little bit more there, Sally.

Speaker 4: 
48:51-48:55
I was just trying to remember from contract law that if there is

Speaker 4: 
48:55-48:58
With that retention of title in certain cases.

Speaker 1: 
48:59-48:59
Which one?

Speaker 1: 
49:00-49:00
Sorry?

Speaker 4: 
49:00-49:07
I think it was under contract law with the retention of title that if someone hasn't paid until they've paid.

Speaker 4: 
49:08-49:13
that means that the legal ownership or the legal title is with the seller.

Speaker 4: 
49:13-49:19
And therefore, if you are going to go and buy something, you can actually look something up on the PPSR and check

Speaker 4: 
49:19-49:27
if it's there or in and I can't remember exactly how to do it, but that means that they don't actually hold the right to sell those goods.

Speaker 4: 
49:27-49:34
And then perhaps if they did default on something, you have first or the original seller of the goods

Speaker 4: 
49:33-49:37
has first claimed to title over any other subsequent creditor.

Speaker 4: 
49:37-49:38
Is that right?

Speaker 1: 
49:39-49:43
Yes, that's considering the fact that the property would be on the PPSR.

Speaker 1: 
49:43-49:45
Not all properties listed on the PPSR.

Speaker 1: 
49:47-49:50
So here we're going one step prior to that.

Speaker 1: 
49:50-49:50
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
49:51-49:55
But in so Sally is referring to and we will talk about the PBSR.

Speaker 1: 
49:55-49:59
Sally's referring to and thank you, a register

Speaker 1: 
49:59-50:04
whereby, for example, let's just say someone is selling something to you.

Speaker 1: 
50:04-50:10
You can check to see whether or not that the goods are encumbered by way of a loan or whatever it is.

Speaker 1: 
50:11-50:11
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
50:12-50:13
A car, yes.

Speaker 1: 
50:15-50:17
But here, we're first employing first principles.

Speaker 1: 
50:17-50:27
And what we're saying is that you may, for example, suggest to your client that they consider a Romalpa clause

Speaker 1: 
50:28-50:38
In their contract, a retention of title clause to protect them in the event that the person who's buying the goods from them doesn't run foul of them.

Speaker 1: 
50:40-50:46
The risk the risk of loss or damage to goods prima facie passes with their ownership.

Speaker 1: 
50:46-50:52
So ownership of goods does not necessarily vest in the buyer simply because they have possession.

Speaker 1: 
50:55-51:03
And the general rule is that transferee of goods cannot obtain a better title than the transfereu.

Speaker 1: 
51:06-51:10
In other words, there is transfer when there is transfer.

Speaker 1: 
51:14-51:16
I would suggest so, yes.

Speaker 1: 
51:16-51:17
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
51:18-51:22
Sally, it would be very prudent advice.

Speaker 1: 
51:22-51:24
A contract is performed.

Speaker 1: 
51:26-51:40
And a term regarding the performance of the contract occurs when A sells a boat to B and hands them the key so that they may take delivery.

Speaker 1: 
51:40-51:41
Constructive delivery.

Speaker 1: 
51:42-51:46
A delivery of documents amounts to constructive delivery of goods.

Speaker 1: 
51:46-51:48
In other words,

Speaker 1: 
51:48-51:55
the steps that need to be taken in order for that contract to be performed have been undertaken.

Speaker 1: 
52:01-52:08
When you're accepting goods, if someone who has bought something fails to accept the goods

Speaker 1: 
52:08-52:13
It may well be that they are liable.

Speaker 1: 
52:13-52:20
I'm not sure, Sally, regarding removal clause and sale of real estate

Speaker 1: 
52:19-52:27
But there are other clauses that govern that that are implied in real estate contracts and that are expressed in real estate contracts.

Speaker 1: 
52:29-52:36
So a buyer's failure to accept the goods renders them liable for breach of contract unless there is a right to reject them.

Speaker 1: 
52:36-52:40
So can you see that the performance is on all sides?

Speaker 1: 
52:41-52:48
And this is when a buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods.

Speaker 1: 
52:48-52:52
When they intimate that this has occurred

Speaker 1: 
52:51-52:58
when they've been delivered, and the buyer does not act with any other manner inconsistent with the seller's ownership.

Speaker 1: 
53:00-53:05
And when the buyer retains a good for longer than a reasonable time.

Speaker 1: 
53:05-53:07
So look at the behaviours.

Speaker 1: 
53:08-53:14
Then the closing moments, you know, time together how it flies.

Speaker 1: 
53:14-53:16
But look at the remedies.

Speaker 1: 
53:18-53:24
So it's what you said before, Montana unpaid seller.

Speaker 1: 
53:24-53:29
A seller of goods is unpaid when these criteria have been.

Speaker 1: 
53:28-53:29
Met.

Speaker 1: 
53:29-53:39
The whole of the price has not been paid or tendered, or something that is the base of negotiation has been received as a conditional payment but is dishonored.

Speaker 1: 
53:40-53:43
In other words, someone has given someone, for example, a check.

Speaker 1: 
53:42-53:45
and it's dishonoured or unfulfilled.

Speaker 1: 
53:46-53:56
So someone who is selling and has not been paid has these types of rights

Speaker 1: 
53:57-54:02
They have rights against the goods and they have rights against the buyer.

Speaker 1: 
54:04-54:08
They have against the goods they may have the right of lean

Speaker 1: 
54:08-54:15
or a link, when ownership has passed to the buyer, but the seller has possession.

Speaker 1: 
54:15-54:19
They may be able to withhold delivery

Speaker 1: 
54:20-54:24
They may be able to sell or stop the goods in transit.

Speaker 1: 
54:25-54:28
They may be able to resell.

Speaker 1: 
54:29-54:30
Okay.

Speaker 1: 
54:30-54:33
So these are the main remedies.

Speaker 4: 
54:35-54:41
Can you just clarify, Lee and like if you've got a Lien over something

Speaker 4: 
54:41-54:48
you said ownerships passed to the buyer, so the buyer owns it, but the possession is with the seller.

Speaker 4: 
54:48-54:53
So you haven't actually given them the goods, the seller

Speaker 4: 
54:52-54:57
So the seller's giving them goods and the person has bought it, but they haven't paid for it.

Speaker 4: 
54:57-54:59
Do you need the Lien?

Speaker 1: 
55:00-55:01
I don't understand that.

Speaker 4: 
55:01-55:03
I'm a bit confused about that

Speaker 1: 
55:03-55:08
Yes, so the buyer has the legal ownership of the property.

Speaker 1: 
55:08-55:11
So the title has passed to them, for example.

Speaker 1: 
55:11-55:20
But the seller has possession until all of the criteria have been met for the

Speaker 1: 
55:19-55:21
transfer of the property.

Speaker 4: 
55:21-55:27
Right, which would be obviously a condition of the contract would be the financial considerations.

Speaker 1: 
55:27-55:28
Maybe.

Speaker 1: 
55:28-55:31
Yeah, it could be other forms of in the contract too.

Speaker 1: 
55:31-55:32
But in that instance, yep.

Speaker 4: 
55:32-55:33
Yep, okay.

Speaker 1: 
55:33-55:38
As Que said, I bought a car and has yet to pick it up from the dealer.

Speaker 1: 
55:38-55:38
Yeah.

Speaker 2: 
55:46-55:47
Sorry, Nick.

Speaker 2: 
55:47-55:50
That was actually an example that happened to my friend that has a shock.

Speaker 2: 
55:50-55:52
That's why it's saying that.

Speaker 2: 
55:52-55:53
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
55:54-55:55
With the car?

Speaker 2: 
55:55-55:56
With the car.

Speaker 2: 
55:56-55:59
So my friend, he's a lawyer and he's got a a panel beating shop.

Speaker 2: 
55:59-56:04
And that literally that exact same situation because he was quizzing me, you know

Speaker 2: 
56:03-56:05
as a law student.

Speaker 1: 
56:05-56:08
And that's of course you did not provide any legal advice.

Speaker 2: 
56:09-56:10
No, I definitely didn't.

Speaker 2: 
56:10-56:11
He's a lawyer.

Speaker 2: 
56:11-56:13
He's a lawyer trying to give me the legal advice.

Speaker 1: 
56:13-56:15
It doesn't mean he's a good lawyer

Speaker 2: 
56:16-56:17
Definitely not.

Speaker 1: 
56:18-56:19
No, I'm not saying that about you, mate.

Speaker 1: 
56:20-56:20
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
56:20-56:21
So what did he do?

Speaker 1: 
56:21-56:26
Is he is he out hold on to a a Mustang or a V8 for the last nine years or what?

Speaker 2: 
56:28-56:29
Yeah, one of those cars.

Speaker 2: 
56:30-56:33
Um, from my understanding, it's just sitting there.

Speaker 2: 
56:33-56:34
I don't know.

Speaker 2: 
56:34-56:38
I think it became um

Speaker 2: 
56:37-56:46
Yes, I think there was a few text messages that were exchanged and that unfortunately compromised him as a solicitor

Speaker 1: 
56:46-56:48
So with a couple of emojis.

Speaker 2: 
56:49-56:51
With a couple of emojis, correct.

Speaker 1: 
56:52-56:53
Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1: 
56:54-56:57
It's if you know, you know.

Speaker 1: 
56:57-57:02
Now we'll go a couple of moments over, but this is recorded if you need to go, go.

Speaker 1: 
57:02-57:04
If you need to stay, stay.

Speaker 1: 
57:04-57:08
So rights of an unpaid seller against the buyer.

Speaker 1: 
57:08-57:16
So unless otherwise agreed, when the goods are delivered and payment so the delivery of goods and payment are usually concurrent.

Speaker 1: 
57:16-57:18
They happen at the same time.

Speaker 1: 
57:20-57:27
Where the property in the goods is not passed to the buyer and they do not pay, the seller may sue the buyer for the price.

Speaker 1: 
57:27-57:30
So in other words, yes, no worries.

Speaker 1: 
57:30-57:32
Have a great weekend

Speaker 1: 
57:32-57:41
The buyer so with the property in the goods is passed to the buyer, so the buyer gets the property and they've not paid

Speaker 1: 
57:41-57:44
The seller may actually sue the buyer for the price.

Speaker 1: 
57:45-57:52
There is also a remedy whereby that there could be damages sought for non-acceptance

Speaker 1: 
57:51-57:59
The general rule is the measure of damages is estimated by the loss directly and naturally resulting.

Speaker 1: 
57:59-58:01
Now, what does this mean practically

Speaker 1: 
58:02-58:11
What loss directly and as a result of the buyer's breach has occurred?

Speaker 1: 
58:12-58:20
You quantify that, and that forms the basis for your damages in the case of non acceptance.

Speaker 1: 
58:24-58:30
The buyer is also able to rescind the contract and reject the goods.

Speaker 1: 
58:33-58:39
So remember, it allows for you to say that this contract is done, finished.

Speaker 1: 
58:41-58:52
However, to repudiate the contract, you may lose that right when there has been a waiver of a condition

Speaker 1: 
58:52-59:02
which is an essential term, or there's been an agreement to treat an essential term as a liciter or warranty.

Speaker 1: 
59:08-59:13
The contract is for specific goods, yes, and the property in them has passed to the buyer.

Speaker 1: 
59:14-59:17
So in other words, what you're basically saying is that you've received the goods.

Speaker 1: 
59:19-59:32
And the reason for that also may be sadly that it may be very difficult then for the seller to be able to sell that specific good because you might be the only person in the world who wants a piano that looks like an elephant.

Speaker 1: 
59:33-59:37
Remedies of the buyer, damages for breach of warranty of quality.

Speaker 1: 
59:38-59:42
So where there is a breach of quality

Speaker 1: 
59:43-59:47
The buyer so it was a breach of quality by the seller.

Speaker 1: 
59:48-59:54
The buyer is not by that reason alone entitled to reject the goods

Speaker 1: 
59:53-59:59
The buyer may set up the price of a warranty or set up the breach of warranty.

Speaker 1: 
01:00:00-01:00:05
In other words, they may they will measure the damages that have been incurred

Speaker 1: 
01:00:05-01:00:13
And they may ask for those damages because of whatever loss that they've experienced.

Speaker 1: 
01:00:13-01:00:16
by a way of the breach of conditions through their action.

Speaker 1: 
01:00:16-01:00:17
Yes, it is possible.

Speaker 1: 
01:00:17-01:00:23
Yes, it is possible to do it by way of their actions

Speaker 1: 
01:00:23-01:00:27
So when you're looking through these problems, ask yourself this.

Speaker 1: 
01:00:28-01:00:32
Are we talking about the buyer in this case

Speaker 1: 
01:00:32-01:00:34
We are looking at the remedies of the buyer.

Speaker 1: 
01:00:34-01:00:36
We're looking at the remedies of the buyer.

Speaker 1: 
01:00:36-01:00:38
What has the buyer experienced?

Speaker 1: 
01:00:38-01:00:41
Well, they've experienced a breach from the seller.

Speaker 1: 
01:00:42-01:00:48
No, you look at the fact that they've actually experienced damages as a result of a breach of warranty.

Speaker 1: 
01:00:48-01:00:51
Then you follow this

Speaker 1: 
01:00:51-01:00:56
Or you say they've experienced non delivery.

Speaker 1: 
01:00:56-01:00:57
You follow this.

Speaker 1: 
01:00:58-01:01:05
Where the seller wrongfully fails to deliver the goods to the buyer, the buyer may bring an action for non delivery.

Speaker 1: 
01:01:06-01:01:13
It's based on an estimated loss directly

Speaker 1: 
01:01:13-01:01:20
And naturally, so maybe I've lost this and I've also lost the ability to oncel this.

Speaker 1: 
01:01:21-01:01:28
So you look at am I going for the buyer's remedies or the seller's remedies and what has happened.

Speaker 1: 
01:01:29-01:01:36
So here, specific performance, where the seller fails to deliver specific or ascertained goods,

Speaker 1: 
01:01:36-01:01:40
The court may direct specific performance, if possible.

Speaker 1: 
01:01:41-01:01:49
Now the idea here is that the court will generally not make someone

Speaker 1: 
01:01:50-01:02:01
Because you cannot actually make someone, for example, it's very difficult to make someone agree to sell or deliver chattels unless the goods are unique or a special kind.

Speaker 1: 
01:02:02-01:02:13
So what the court will say is, you know what, we can't make you sell that, but what we will do is we'll attach some sort of financial damages to this.

Speaker 1: 
01:02:13-01:02:27
unless it's a one of a kind, and there would not be some sort of financial recompense that would be able to restore the person who's been aggrieved by this to the position they were in beforehand.

Speaker 1: 
01:02:31-01:02:34
Can a buyer also start a claim hang on a sec.

Speaker 1: 
01:02:34-01:02:39
Can a buyer also start a claim in torts and contract at the same time?

Speaker 1: 
01:02:39-01:02:41
Yes, you are allowed to have.

Speaker 1: 
01:02:42-01:02:45
claims, but you do have to make the quarter weather, that's what's happening.

Speaker 1: 
01:02:45-01:02:47
That's my understanding.

Speaker 1: 
01:02:48-01:02:50
It is possible to have partial performance.

Speaker 1: 
01:02:50-01:02:52
Yes, you can accept that

Speaker 1: 
01:02:52-01:03:00
What are about misrepresentations in the case of a question example, would it have fallen under specific performance as to not matching a description?

Speaker 1: 
01:03:01-01:03:02
Well, in that instance

Speaker 1: 
01:03:02-01:03:11
if you're saying that the specific that they are ascertained or let's just say specific goods, yes, it may.

Speaker 1: 
01:03:13-01:03:18
Now we ran out of time to do Bianca, so maybe next week I'll do that first.

Speaker 1: 
01:03:18-01:03:23
But what I'll do is maybe I'll just record a bit of Bianca tomorrow and I'll upload it.

Speaker 1: 
01:03:23-01:03:25
Is everyone happy with that?

Speaker 4: 
01:03:27-01:03:34
Yes, and can I just ask Nick, in regards to this, we look at this obviously from Bianca's

Speaker 4: 
01:03:34-01:03:42
Situation and taking Bianca's word for it that when she opened it, all of those things were not new, but

Speaker 4: 
01:03:42-01:03:54
Can we also consider or could you touch on what about from a seller's point of view where a seller sells something and sends it, for example, over eBay or whatever of a genuine item?

Speaker 4: 
01:03:54-01:04:02
And someone else then contacts them and says, you've sent me a fake and have substituted a fake.

Speaker 4: 
01:04:02-01:04:03
What happens there?

Speaker 4: 
01:04:03-01:04:05
How does one prove authenticity?

Speaker 4: 
01:04:06-01:04:07
How do they prove

Speaker 4: 
01:04:07-01:04:14
That, like I'd know, you know, how does a buyer protect themselves, or where does that fit within this legislation in that respect?

Speaker 1: 
01:04:15-01:04:22
Well, that would be up to the person who's received the property and is stating that it's not the property that it should be to make that out.

Speaker 4: 
01:04:23-01:04:25
They'd have to provide evidence.

Speaker 4: 
01:04:25-01:04:33
So, in the same way that Bianca has to provide evidence that she didn't open the box and then put her old items inside it.

Speaker 1: 
01:04:37-01:04:44
So what I'll do tomorrow, because I know people have to go, tomorrow or Sunday, I'll upload the material there.

Speaker 1: 
01:04:44-01:04:48
Also, I'll go back and have a look at all of your Bianca questions.

Speaker 1: 
01:04:50-01:04:51
Saturday.

Speaker 1: 
01:04:51-01:04:54
All right, Ma, if you say Saturday, Saturday it is.

Speaker 1: 
01:04:54-01:05:00
I'll go back and have a look and just pop some

Speaker 1: 
01:04:59-01:05:00
Points and questions in there.

Speaker 1: 
01:05:01-01:05:08
And then you can ask me next week, and maybe we'll flip around and maybe do the problem first, depending on how many slides there are

Speaker 1: 
01:05:08-01:05:11
But I do like to get to your questions as well.

Speaker 1: 
01:05:11-01:05:16
Anyway, listen, folks, it's a balance, all right?

Speaker 1: 
01:05:16-01:05:18
These sessions are dynamic.

Speaker 1: 
01:05:18-01:05:21
So I know some people say, oh, we spend too much time on this

Speaker 1: 
01:05:21-01:05:23
Not enough time on that.

Speaker 1: 
01:05:23-01:05:26
The thrust and battery of life.

Speaker 1: 
01:05:27-01:05:30
Okay, so I'll run through that tomorrow

Speaker 1: 
01:05:30-01:05:32
And you can email me with questions and queries.

Speaker 3: 
01:05:33-01:05:34
Lovely to see you.

Speaker 3: 
01:05:34-01:05:36
If you need anything else, feel free to stay behind.

Speaker 3: 
01:05:37-01:05:39
What did we have on question number twenty one?

Speaker 3: 
01:05:40-01:05:43
I'll also do it with activity number two point zero.
