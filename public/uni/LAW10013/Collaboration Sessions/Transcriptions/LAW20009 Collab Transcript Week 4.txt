Speaker 1: 
00:01-00:03
Yeah, thanks, Cheryl.

Speaker 1: 
00:03-00:06
That's um thank you.

Speaker 1: 
00:07-00:08
Hello, everyone.

Speaker 1: 
00:09-00:15
Welcome to week number two or the second part of

Speaker 1: 
00:14-00:17
our session on international contracts.

Speaker 1: 
00:17-00:23
And we've got our session today at eight thirty in the morning.

Speaker 1: 
00:23-00:27
So thank you all for coming on in and

Speaker 1: 
00:26-00:32
Enjoying the morning breakfast at Swinburne Online.

Speaker 1: 
00:33-00:40
So I just wanted to first of all ask any questions or queries

Speaker 1: 
00:40-00:44
Anyone got anything they want to ask about?

Speaker 1: 
00:44-00:46
Content, assignments, anything of the like?

Speaker 1: 
00:50-00:54
Okay, let's get cracking.

Speaker 1: 
00:54-00:58
So this way it's a bit of a

Speaker 1: 
00:59-01:09
a different approach in terms of we don't really have slides or we don't have slides per se because what we're going to focus on is

Speaker 1: 
01:08-01:14
We're going to focus on the discussion questions and looking at really what the Unidroi principles are.

Speaker 1: 
01:14-01:18
Now, has anyone had a go at actually pronouncing that?

Speaker 1: 
01:18-01:21
Unidroi, Unidroat, Unidroit

Speaker 1: 
01:21-01:23
Unidro IT.

Speaker 1: 
01:23-01:24
Who's had a go?

Speaker 1: 
01:24-01:28
Come on, let's play Pronounce with Nick.

Speaker 2: 
01:31-01:34
Um hi Nick, I've been saying uni droit.

Speaker 2: 
01:35-01:35
Like it knows.

Speaker 2: 
01:37-01:38
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
01:38-01:39
Love it, Nicole.

Speaker 1: 
01:40-01:42
Graham has been saying same.

Speaker 1: 
01:43-01:45
Well, same isn't part of it, Graham.

Speaker 1: 
01:46-01:49
There's a bit of early morning humor for you.

Speaker 1: 
01:50-01:55
Uni, I was sort of thinking, Droy, is that French for right?

Speaker 1: 
01:55-01:58
I'm just making stuff up, anyhow.

Speaker 1: 
02:01-02:05
I guess forest for the trees and all that.

Speaker 1: 
02:06-02:10
But I want to begin with this question.

Speaker 1: 
02:11-02:23
And the first of the questions being, why do we have or how would you explain the Unidroit Unidroid IT, Unidroid principles

Speaker 1: 
02:23-02:23
What are they?

Speaker 1: 
02:24-02:33
This is a very important thing for us to consider what they are first, and then we'll worry about

Speaker 1: 
02:34-02:35
How to apply them.

Speaker 1: 
02:35-02:40
Does anyone want to give us a a sense of what they are?

Speaker 1: 
02:43-02:50
Guidelines for international contracts that fill in the CSCISG gaps?

Speaker 1: 
02:50-02:53
Yes, so let's take a step backwards, first of all

Speaker 1: 
02:54-02:57
What is the CISG?

Speaker 1: 
03:02-03:06
So, you should be able now to see these principles here.

Speaker 1: 
03:06-03:08
What are we talking about?

Speaker 1: 
03:11-03:16
If your mics are working, do give them a go because I'm trying to be across a number of screens.

Speaker 1: 
03:16-03:21
So what do we got here?

Speaker 1: 
03:25-03:32
So we have a convention, a convention, a convention for international contracts.

Speaker 1: 
03:31-03:35
the Convention of International Sales Sale of Goods.

Speaker 1: 
03:35-03:38
So let's start with that.

Speaker 1: 
03:38-03:41
Being a convention, what are we asserting that this is?

Speaker 1: 
04:03-04:04
Thanks, folks.

Speaker 1: 
04:06-04:13
I feel like I'm doing one of those Instagram lives where all the cool people get on there trying to get through the comments.

Speaker 1: 
04:13-04:18
I know that you may be in various states of repair or disrepair, and thank you for answering.

Speaker 1: 
04:19-04:27
But if I may, also just impress upon you, if your mics are working, if you could use your mics.

Speaker 1: 
04:27-04:29
Okay, it just makes life a whole lot easier.

Speaker 1: 
04:30-04:35
You know, I love you, but let's try and see if the mics are working.

Speaker 1: 
04:35-04:38
If they're not, just keep typing.

Speaker 1: 
04:38-04:39
An agreement between parties.

Speaker 1: 
04:40-04:40
Convention.

Speaker 1: 
04:41-04:42
Love affair with words.

Speaker 1: 
04:42-04:44
What do we mean by convention?

Speaker 1: 
04:52-04:55
So a group of states, group of countries got together.

Speaker 1: 
04:58-04:59
It's okay, Graham.

Speaker 1: 
04:59-05:04
Everyone's in states of repair or otherwise, and I'm not suggesting you aren't.

Speaker 1: 
05:04-05:06
But the call still goes out there.

Speaker 1: 
05:06-05:11
If your mics are working and you're able to use them, that would probably be

Speaker 1: 
05:12-05:16
The best way to communicate, in amongst all other ways.

Speaker 1: 
05:16-05:21
Now, a group of countries got together

Speaker 1: 
05:21-05:24
And I agreed upon something.

Speaker 1: 
05:25-05:27
What did I agree upon?

Speaker 2: 
05:32-05:36
Legally binding rules that govern international contracts.

Speaker 1: 
05:37-05:44
And what is the basis upon which this agreement was made, such that

Speaker 1: 
05:44-05:51
These rules/slash principles, what would they do?

Speaker 1: 
05:56-05:58
They would provide what?

Speaker 2: 
05:59-06:05
Consistency and uniformity across jurisdictions.

Speaker 1: 
06:06-06:06
Thank you.

Speaker 1: 
06:07-06:18
So leading on from part one last week, what would the key to suggesting, for example, that we're going to

Speaker 1: 
06:18-06:27
abide by such principles B that parties would have a common and uniform

Speaker 1: 
06:27-06:35
Base of Principles and Rules to Achieve Particular Objectives

Speaker 1: 
06:36-06:46
Now, as you noted earlier, these principles are indicated as being for what?

Speaker 1: 
06:48-06:50
All types of contracts?

Speaker 2: 
06:52-06:53
No, the sale of goods.

Speaker 1: 
06:54-06:55
Sale of goods.

Speaker 1: 
06:55-07:02
And predominantly or not predominantly, if we look at aspects of international trade

Speaker 1: 
07:01-07:09
And the sale of goods what are they hoping to harmonise if not

Speaker 1: 
07:09-07:18
really harmonize so that we don't have sort of issues across borders or to allow really for the movement of goods.

Speaker 1: 
07:19-07:23
Yes, rules of trade and movement of goods between jurisdictions.

Speaker 1: 
07:25-07:33
Now these are non-legislative and they relate to the general law.

Speaker 1: 
07:34-07:40
They are based upon the law of international contracts.

Speaker 1: 
07:41-07:45
So when we talk about nonlegislative, what are we suggesting?

Speaker 1: 
07:46-07:50
What does it mean for something to be non-legislative in nature?

Speaker 3: 
08:02-08:04
Yes, all of these things are quite interesting.

Speaker 1: 
08:05-08:09
Not legally binding, nonbinding, it's not law, informal.

Speaker 1: 
08:10-08:12
Well

Speaker 1: 
08:11-08:15
It's not stated in any yes, soft law.

Speaker 1: 
08:15-08:18
It's not stated in any legislation.

Speaker 1: 
08:20-08:31
Okay, so we don't have the piece of legislation that someone can point to and say well, subject to this piece of legislation, X, Y and Z is or isn't happening.

Speaker 1: 
08:31-08:34
But we do have principles.

Speaker 1: 
08:35-08:37
And these principles are guiding in nature.

Speaker 1: 
08:37-08:42
And what can the parties do according to these principles if they choose to?

Speaker 1: 
08:53-08:56
Yes, they can sue on the basis that what?

Speaker 1: 
08:59-09:03
on the basis that they've agreed to be bound by them.

Speaker 1: 
09:04-09:05
Okay.

Speaker 4: 
09:05-09:12
So is this can I ask a question like is this similar to you know how

Speaker 4: 
09:12-09:16
Recently, the federal court granted a group of women the ability to sue the Qatari government.

Speaker 4: 
09:16-09:23
Would that that sort of contract between those two parties is that is that similar to the unit drawer principles?

Speaker 4: 
09:23-09:24
Or is that

Speaker 1: 
09:25-09:26
I'm not aware of that.

Speaker 1: 
09:27-09:28
I'm not aware of that.

Speaker 1: 
09:28-09:28
That's all.

Speaker 4: 
09:28-09:32
So like there were five women that were like invasively.

Speaker 1: 
09:34-09:37
Oh, through the Qatari government.

Speaker 1: 
09:38-09:41
They were Australian the Australian travelers that were.

Speaker 4: 
09:42-09:45
The federal court has now granted them

Speaker 4: 
09:44-09:50
uh the ability to sue the k I think the the Qatari like Aviation Authority, I think.

Speaker 1: 
09:51-09:54
That that would be a matter of uh to the extent

Speaker 1: 
09:54-10:05
just based on what you're telling me, that would be a matter of the court s um indicating that the federal court in Australia indicating that the

Speaker 1: 
10:05-10:15
the action is able to proceed on the basis of the following, that there is a forum, that Australia is a forum within which such action can take place.

Speaker 1: 
10:15-10:24
Place because it's very important when there is action for there to be a forum in which the action will take place.

Speaker 1: 
10:24-10:35
One of the arguments may be that, for example, a company or a government is not able to be sued in a particular forum because of the fact that

Speaker 1: 
10:35-10:40
the forum or the jurisdiction does not have any legal sway.

Speaker 1: 
10:40-10:43
So the argument may be, for example, that the

Speaker 1: 
10:43-10:53
There's no legal sway that Australia can have on the Qatari government or the Qatar Airlines or whomever it was that did whatever it is that they did.

Speaker 1: 
10:54-10:56
And then that can be a matter of law.

Speaker 1: 
10:56-11:07
So the court will look at it and say, well, hang on a flash, this company or this government has got a connection to Australia in the following way or is able to be sued in Australia.

Speaker 1: 
11:07-11:08
And that's what that would say.

Speaker 1: 
11:09-11:09
Okay.

Speaker 1: 
11:11-11:19
So the principles will guide the decision making processes and will also

Speaker 1: 
11:18-11:20
Are based on a number of things.

Speaker 1: 
11:20-11:22
They're based on the articulated principles.

Speaker 1: 
11:22-11:24
What else are they based upon?

Speaker 1: 
11:24-11:27
What other body of law?

Speaker 4: 
11:28-11:29
Common law.

Speaker 1: 
11:32-11:33
Common law.

Speaker 1: 
11:33-11:39
And one of the tasks for this week was to consider aspects of common law.

Speaker 1: 
11:42-11:50
and to look at how it is that these would relate to this area that we're covering.

Speaker 1: 
11:50-11:52
So

Speaker 1: 
11:52-12:00
It says review the fourteen cases on the Unilex database and consider how they may relate to the Unidroit principles.

Speaker 1: 
12:00-12:02
You're only required to read the abstract.

Speaker 1: 
12:03-12:05
Well, let's go through some of these things.

Speaker 1: 
12:05-12:08
First of all, let's go through some of the principles.

Speaker 1: 
12:08-12:10
What are some of the principles?

Speaker 1: 
12:22-12:23
What are their focus?

Speaker 1: 
12:23-12:25
What kind of focuses do they have?

Speaker 1: 
12:26-12:29
The focus is on the sale of goods, yes.

Speaker 1: 
12:30-12:31
And what what other things?

Speaker 1: 
12:31-12:34
What kind of things would they bring to the fore?

Speaker 4: 
12:41-12:41
Sorry?

Speaker 4: 
12:42-12:45
Would they would they focus focus on dispute resolution as well?

Speaker 1: 
12:45-12:52
Yes, but in terms of how they go about doing all of these things, folks, what have we got?

Speaker 1: 
12:53-12:56
They don't so much focus just on interpretation.

Speaker 1: 
12:56-13:00
They're a touch more a touch more direct than

Speaker 1: 
13:00-13:01
That surely.

Speaker 1: 
13:01-13:04
Cooperation and fair dealing, yes.

Speaker 1: 
13:04-13:13
So they indicate: number one, that there must be good faith and fair dealing.

Speaker 1: 
13:16-13:18
They cover the breadth of contract law issues.

Speaker 1: 
13:18-13:24
I wouldn't say the breadth, but they do contact contract law issues, yes.

Speaker 1: 
13:24-13:27
I would say a breadth rather than the breadth.

Speaker 1: 
13:31-13:34
So they focus on things such as fair dealing.

Speaker 1: 
13:34-13:37
What do we mean by fair dealing?

Speaker 4: 
13:40-13:44
I guess parties not getting together and price fixing, for instance?

Speaker 1: 
13:45-13:45
Yeah.

Speaker 4: 
13:47-13:48
What else?

Speaker 4: 
13:53-13:58
I guess predatory marketing practices or fraudulent business practices?

Speaker 1: 
14:02-14:11
I guess, I mean, in a general sense, yes, but I mean, specific to things such as

Speaker 1: 
14:11-14:14
the international sale of goods.

Speaker 1: 
14:15-14:18
They also look at practices.

Speaker 1: 
14:18-14:20
Yes, they also look at practices.

Speaker 1: 
14:20-14:22
What about

Speaker 1: 
14:22-14:30
with respect to who is able to sell goods, are there any principles that relate to authority or agency to sell?

Speaker 1: 
14:33-14:35
Yes, covers agency law.

Speaker 1: 
14:35-14:39
Now why do you think there would be an area that would cover agency law?

Speaker 4: 
14:45-14:50
Can you maybe expand a little bit about what agency law actually is?

Speaker 4: 
14:50-14:54
Is that when a company has the agency to make

Speaker 4: 
14:55-14:56
a deal with somebody else?

Speaker 1: 
14:56-15:03
Like without ostensibly, it relates to a number of things.

Speaker 1: 
15:03-15:05
Yeah, yeah, I'd be happy to do that.

Speaker 1: 
15:06-15:18
It relates to the ability of a company or someone who is said to be an agent of the company.

Speaker 1: 
15:19-15:28
representing the company, either expressly or impliedly, to enter into agreements that bind the company.

Speaker 1: 
15:29-15:41
Now, what can happen and this remember when we first met, we said that commercial law is a miasma, a bringing together of a number of areas of law indeed.

Speaker 1: 
15:41-15:45
And one of these being, say, for example, a contract law.

Speaker 1: 
15:45-15:51
If you remember from those heady contract law days when we were all sort of young and tiptoeing through the tulip

Speaker 1: 
15:53-16:01
that there are certain situations in which a company can be bound through a number of ways

Speaker 1: 
16:01-16:11
including through its directors, through people who are authorized to make contracts, through agents

Speaker 1: 
16:10-16:24
So agency, as it refers to in commerce, is aligned with its everyday meaning, which suggests that someone is an agent

Speaker 1: 
16:25-16:31
Able to undertake activities on behalf of someone else.

Speaker 1: 
16:31-16:33
And in this instance,

Speaker 1: 
16:33-16:46
it relates to the principles that would bring to the fore and allow for an argument of or allow for the ability of someone to say, I'm representing this company

Speaker 1: 
16:46-16:49
And I bind this company in the following manner.

Speaker 1: 
16:49-16:50
Does that help?

Speaker 4: 
16:51-16:52
Yes, thank you.

Speaker 1: 
16:54-17:00
So it is common in distribution that principles were licensed with agents in specific countries.

Speaker 1: 
17:00-17:01
Excuse me.

Speaker 1: 
17:01-17:02
Yes, Nicole, go ahead.

Speaker 1: 
17:02-17:04
What what what do you mean by that?

Speaker 1: 
17:04-17:08
Why is that something, for example, that when we talk about the sale of goods?

Speaker 1: 
17:08-17:10
this would be important.

Speaker 2: 
17:11-17:20
Well, it binds the agents that are representing the principal company in specific regions to act

Speaker 2: 
17:19-17:21
as per the principal would.

Speaker 2: 
17:21-17:25
So it enforces that standard on the agents.

Speaker 1: 
17:26-17:33
And why is that something that in the context of say the sale of goods or

Speaker 1: 
17:32-17:37
in the context of this type of trade and commerce, that we would focus on?

Speaker 2: 
17:38-17:46
Because it ensures predictability of outcomes, which is kind of, I guess, the premise or one of the foundations of commercial law.

Speaker 1: 
17:47-17:55
Yeah, and I'm one of those people that will sort of trape through the use of words.

Speaker 1: 
17:55-17:57
And thank you very, very much.

Speaker 1: 
17:58-18:01
When you say insures, can it really insure it?

Speaker 2: 
18:04-18:17
Well, I mean it's I mean, it's not it's not legally binding, but I guess unless it's in the agreement, obviously, between the principal and the agent.

Speaker 2: 
18:17-18:26
But I guess as common law develops around that in particular jurisdictions, it will become more so in my view.

Speaker 1: 
18:27-18:31
No, in your view and in the view of jurists, Your Honor.

Speaker 4: 
18:31-18:31
Well done.

Speaker 4: 
18:34-18:41
Like you know how there's a dispute well, everybody knows that there's a dispute with the but does this also cover things like tariffs between countries?

Speaker 1: 
18:41-18:43
Or is this separate from that?

Speaker 1: 
18:44-18:53
Well, you see, the thing is, these principles and these agreements are only as valid as people seek to make them

Speaker 4: 
18:53-18:54
Right.

Speaker 4: 
18:54-18:58
So it's basically like bigger parties being able to bully smaller ones effectively.

Speaker 1: 
18:58-18:58
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
18:59-19:07
I mean, this is sort of when everyone sort of gets together around a table or on Zoom with

Speaker 1: 
19:07-19:13
Catering and handshakes and hugs and guffaws, and they agree to be bound by particular regulations.

Speaker 1: 
19:14-19:15
Well, that's what they do.

Speaker 1: 
19:15-19:17
And then someone else says, Oh, you know what?

Speaker 1: 
19:17-19:19
We ain't going to do that anymore

Speaker 1: 
19:19-19:23
Well, I think it sort of gets into a number of things.

Speaker 1: 
19:23-19:31
First of all, there is an ability to take action against people, but as to whether or not it's something that would be

Speaker 1: 
19:31-19:38
go beyond some some international condemnation.

Speaker 1: 
19:38-19:43
And the effect of that depends on who the country is

Speaker 4: 
19:43-19:44
And whether or not they really give us stuff.

Speaker 4: 
19:45-19:48
Yeah, well and whether or not they have any shame whatsoever.

Speaker 4: 
19:48-19:53
Well, I mean, you know, collective shame we've worked out doesn't really work.

Speaker 4: 
19:54-19:57
It doesn't it does in Southeast Asian countries, just not in the Western ones.

Speaker 4: 
19:58-19:59
I don't know.

Speaker 1: 
20:00-20:06
I'm afraid my geography is limited to

Speaker 1: 
20:05-20:08
other parts, so I don't I don't know.

Speaker 1: 
20:08-20:13
Um, but I would dare say that, you know, there's no there's no better interest than self interest.

Speaker 1: 
20:14-20:17
So as yeah, um

Speaker 1: 
20:18-20:30
as principled as countries may or may not be, ultimately, we do have to relate to the fact that countries, just like people, are usually going to do what's best for them.

Speaker 1: 
20:32-20:37
So in this instance, these are the types of things that the principles cover.

Speaker 1: 
20:37-20:41
They'll cover the way in which the agreements are made.

Speaker 1: 
20:41-20:50
They'll cover areas which revolve around who is able to enter in negotiations for companies

Speaker 1: 
20:50-20:56
And again, let's just look at the practical aspect of agency before we move on.

Speaker 1: 
20:56-21:00
Why would we need to have some sort of law guiding agents?

Speaker 1: 
21:00-21:04
Why don't we just say to every single company, well, why don't you

Speaker 1: 
21:04-21:12
Every time you need to do something, just get someone from your jurisdiction to connect with someone from their jurisdiction.

Speaker 1: 
21:14-21:21
So if I want to do business or sell something to Brazil, well, yeah, just hop on a plane and go to Brazil.

Speaker 1: 
21:23-21:24
Yeah, it's not practical.

Speaker 1: 
21:25-21:26
It may be fun.

Speaker 1: 
21:26-21:27
I don't know.

Speaker 1: 
21:27-21:33
The extent to which I travel to business is to go from

Speaker 1: 
21:32-21:36
My office to the kitchen, because obviously we're online.

Speaker 1: 
21:37-21:43
But here it also means flexibility

Speaker 1: 
21:42-21:46
It also means the ability to be able to open markets.

Speaker 1: 
21:46-21:51
It also means that there may be

Speaker 1: 
21:50-21:56
Well, maybe I was being a touch cynical before in terms of how binding these things are.

Speaker 1: 
21:57-22:03
But maybe it opens opportunities to markets for industries and countries and all sorts of

Speaker 1: 
22:03-22:14
companies that maybe do not have the financial ability or the resources that others would to put an individual in every country.

Speaker 1: 
22:13-22:19
It allows for distribution rights to actually have some sway and some weight.

Speaker 1: 
22:20-22:22
What other things would it allow for?

Speaker 1: 
22:23-22:32
it would allow for people who have an understanding of local customs, local cultures, local practices to be able to be more effective in their interactions.

Speaker 4: 
22:33-22:36
Would it affect patents and things like that, on trademarks?

Speaker 1: 
22:38-22:39
In what sense would you suggest?

Speaker 4: 
22:40-22:46
Well, these are principles, right, where they're only as enforceable as people agree that they are.

Speaker 4: 
22:46-22:55
And if you have a global trademark or a global patent, for instance, that's only really as strong as the country that it's enforceable in, right?

Speaker 4: 
22:55-22:59
So is there an agreement to enforce that based on these principles?

Speaker 1: 
22:59-23:09
Yeah, there are overarching agreements that would enforce a global a global instrument of non-global instrument.

Speaker 1: 
23:09-23:15
Yeah, you would have global protection because you would probably you would also have protection in each of those jurisdictions.

Speaker 4: 
23:15-23:16
Right.

Speaker 1: 
23:16-23:19
So, for example, if trademarks weren't protected in some way or form.

Speaker 1: 
23:19-23:28
But however, you can see, for example, and this is sort of on an international scale, but you know, one of the big one of the large sticking points

Speaker 1: 
23:28-23:34
that may occur with trade with, say, China is the theft of intellectual property.

Speaker 5: 
23:34-23:35
Okay?

Speaker 1: 
23:35-23:39
That trademarks are not being observed

Speaker 1: 
23:38-23:44
not being respected, not being upheld, same with copyright and things such as that.

Speaker 1: 
23:44-23:53
Now effectively, the only sort of pressure that can be brought to bear perhaps on especially massive market

Speaker 1: 
23:53-23:58
Is the threat of individual sanctions?

Speaker 1: 
23:59-24:01
When I say sanctions, I mean maybe

Speaker 1: 
24:01-24:06
you know, things that would bring those countries to heal.

Speaker 1: 
24:06-24:14
In other words, the thing that some countries yeah I I I know tariffs and all these things have sort of

Speaker 4: 
24:15-24:16
That doesn't seem to be very effective.

Speaker 1: 
24:17-24:21
They've developed a personality of their own in the last year or so, haven't they?

Speaker 1: 
24:24-24:34
But the idea is that if everyone ascribes to and undertakes whatever practices are in these rules, then you would have a uniform basis

Speaker 1: 
24:34-24:35
So just list these.

Speaker 1: 
24:36-24:39
So we've got good faith, good dealing.

Speaker 1: 
24:39-24:47
Now, one of the things that we need to think about in terms of these principles is the supply chain.

Speaker 1: 
24:47-24:53
So in terms of the supply chain, now what do we mean when we talk about supply chain?

Speaker 1: 
24:54-25:00
Chain, chain, chain, there's a bit of a lot of ultra supply distribution and resale.

Speaker 4: 
25:00-25:01
Sorry, I was being silly.

Speaker 4: 
25:02-25:03
Go again, Russell.

Speaker 4: 
25:03-25:08
Manufacturer manufacturing, wholesaling, distribution and resale, I guess.

Speaker 4: 
25:09-25:14
So the movement of goods from the place of manufacturer to the goods of the consum to the place of the consumer.

Speaker 4: 
25:14-25:20
everything that goes into the provision of supply.

Speaker 1: 
25:21-25:24
Does it include transport?

Speaker 1: 
25:24-25:25
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
25:28-25:37
So do you believe that the these principles would also oh, Julie, all the cogs in the wheel of the deal.

Speaker 1: 
25:37-25:37
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
25:38-25:40
That

Speaker 1: 
25:40-25:41
That sounds cool.

Speaker 1: 
25:42-25:46
So would these principles also apply to areas of supply chain?

Speaker 4: 
25:49-25:51
Not the supply of goods, so yes.

Speaker 1: 
25:52-25:55
And why would it be something that we need to focus on?

Speaker 4: 
25:56-26:03
'Cause that the that environment needs to be just as fair and equal for people as any other trading environment needs to be.

Speaker 4: 
26:04-26:09
Otherwise, you wouldn't you could have parts of the supply chain that could screw up these agreements, I guess.

Speaker 1: 
26:10-26:11
Maybe.

Speaker 1: 
26:11-26:19
Also, it could well be that Company A has a contract with Company B

Speaker 1: 
26:19-26:31
would all of the potential would all of the aspects that determine the performance of that contract rely solely and wholly

Speaker 1: 
26:31-26:34
On those two parties, or could there also be third parties involved?

Speaker 4: 
26:35-26:36
Could also be third parties.

Speaker 1: 
26:41-26:43
So what kind of examples do we have?

Speaker 4: 
26:45-26:46
Can you think of any examples?

Speaker 4: 
26:47-26:54
Well, are you talking about, say, I don't know, a company that makes cars?

Speaker 4: 
26:55-26:57
For another company, for instance.

Speaker 4: 
26:57-26:57
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
27:00-27:05
Nicole says DHL providing forms supplied to

Speaker 1: 
27:04-27:06
From supplier to buy.

Speaker 2: 
27:07-27:09
Sorry, my my typing is terrible.

Speaker 2: 
27:09-27:17
So yes, the DHL would be a third party that is potentially supplying goods from

Speaker 2: 
27:16-27:19
from the supplier to the the end purchaser.

Speaker 1: 
27:20-27:26
So in this context of, say, these principles, how would they apply to someone like a third party?

Speaker 2: 
27:31-27:38
Well, wouldn't it depend on the contract between the supplier and dhl?

Speaker 1: 
27:41-27:42
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
27:42-27:48
I mean, we what's the general position that there is no privity of contract?

Speaker 1: 
27:48-28:01
Okay, so the contract would bind the parties that enter into the contract, but there would be obligations between all of those parties and constituent

Speaker 1: 
28:00-28:03
parts of their supply chain.

Speaker 1: 
28:04-28:08
So how would these principles, therefore, relate to that?

Speaker 1: 
28:16-28:17
Here we are, guys.

Speaker 1: 
28:31-28:43
would there be situations whereby there could be a nonperformance of a contract as a result of supply chain issues?

Speaker 1: 
28:46-28:47
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
28:47-28:54
So in those instances and excuse me whilst I'll grab another piece of technology.

Speaker 1: 
28:54-28:58
In those instances, what would the position be, do you think?

Speaker 1: 
29:08-29:09
Have a go.

Speaker 1: 
29:10-29:12
You don't need to have gone through the material.

Speaker 1: 
29:13-29:15
Use your gut feelings.

Speaker 2: 
29:18-29:28
I still feel it would come down to the individual contracts between the supplier and the third party in the ultimate contract.

Speaker 2: 
29:28-29:30
And then the

Speaker 2: 
29:30-29:37
And then the purchaser and the supplier, like I think it would come, your remedy would come down to those contracts

Speaker 1: 
29:38-29:52
Well, I guess a step before, say, for example, the remedy, let's look at what kind of things do you think that the contract between the parties would include and or exclude.

Speaker 1: 
29:56-30:03
So in the first couple of weeks, we talked about things such as force majeure clauses.

Speaker 4: 
30:07-30:07
Right.

Speaker 4: 
30:07-30:14
So it might you might for instance, a good example might be this the Suez Canal blockade in the Middle East at the moment, preventing Yes.

Speaker 1: 
30:14-30:23
Now, could that be the basis, for example, of one party to suggest that there has been a

Speaker 1: 
30:25-30:26
Let's try that in English.

Speaker 1: 
30:27-30:29
That a contract is not being performed.

Speaker 4: 
30:32-30:32
Sure.

Speaker 4: 
30:32-30:39
I mean, it could could be that, like, a boat that was, you know, contracted to deliver goods for more than one party.

Speaker 4: 
30:39-30:48
has been blockaded or can no longer do that or takes extra long period of time and therefore delays the delivery or prevents the delivery of goods to another party

Speaker 1: 
30:48-30:57
Yes, but legally could party B take so for example, a car manufacturer

Speaker 1: 
30:57-30:59
Ordered cars.

Speaker 1: 
31:00-31:01
Very good example of this.

Speaker 1: 
31:01-31:02
Just stick with me.

Speaker 1: 
31:02-31:03
It's very complicated.

Speaker 1: 
31:04-31:07
A car dealer ordered cars.

Speaker 1: 
31:07-31:15
And those cars are going to go on a boat and they're going to go through a certain area that's been blockaded.

Speaker 1: 
31:15-31:21
So can the car dealer take action against the provider of the cars?

Speaker 1: 
31:21-31:23
To say that the contract was not performed?

Speaker 4: 
31:25-31:32
I guess it depends where that ship is flagged, but I guess that they would take action

Speaker 4: 
31:33-31:42
Yeah, they would they would have to take action against the supplier of the goods to them, and then that supplier might take action against, say, the shipping company or something like that.

Speaker 1: 
31:42-31:55
Yes, I think the position here would be that this is an area that could not be controlled, would be out of the control of the provider of the cars.

Speaker 1: 
31:56-31:56
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
31:58-32:05
So if there was a blockade, I mean, there's not much that the provider of a car can do to assist in that.

Speaker 1: 
32:05-32:08
So one of the things for us is as follows.

Speaker 1: 
32:08-32:13
Now I'll just run through this and I'm using points from your article for the week as well.

Speaker 1: 
32:13-32:15
So excuse me for looking down here.

Speaker 1: 
32:19-32:26
Now it is possible, as we said last week, remember last week where we went through the problem with the rugs and we

Speaker 1: 
32:26-32:38
went through a problem and decided that that particular jurisdiction would apply based on the proper law and which would be where most of the contract has been formed and so forth.

Speaker 1: 
32:38-32:39
Yes?

Speaker 1: 
32:41-32:48
It is possible, though, that parties are unwilling or do not wish to agree

Speaker 1: 
32:48-32:52
on such an application of law, in which they say, you know what?

Speaker 1: 
32:53-32:56
Well, I'm not going to go through

Speaker 1: 
32:56-33:00
this process by trying to sort of figure out which law applies.

Speaker 1: 
33:00-33:04
So we will suggest from the outset

Speaker 1: 
33:05-33:13
A set of principles, a set of laws that will govern our contracts.

Speaker 1: 
33:14-33:26
We're not making a choice as to applicable law, but we're suggesting that we're going to accept

Speaker 1: 
33:26-33:34
these general principles of international commercial law as the basis of our agreement.

Speaker 1: 
33:34-33:37
Is everyone getting a sense of how this works?

Speaker 1: 
33:43-33:44
I'll take that as a yes.

Speaker 1: 
33:47-33:50
Now you may have these now welcome to Latin.

Speaker 1: 
33:50-33:54
You may have these been referred to as the Lex Mercatoria.

Speaker 1: 
33:54-33:58
In other words, the I believe Lex is language.

Speaker 1: 
33:58-33:59
I'm not sure, is it?

Speaker 1: 
34:00-34:01
Latin for language.

Speaker 1: 
34:03-34:11
And I'm just sort of guessing here in terms of mercatoria, but Merck, Mercantile, so I'm guessing the language perhaps of trade

Speaker 1: 
34:11-34:13
or the law of trade.

Speaker 1: 
34:15-34:26
Now the Unidroid principles are available and provide what is believed to be a set of rules

Speaker 1: 
34:26-34:34
That cover all or almost all general and important topics of contract law.

Speaker 1: 
34:38-34:42
They form the basis of the following.

Speaker 1: 
34:47-34:52
Let me just have a look at the most important ones for you.

Speaker 1: 
34:55-35:08
the manner in which agreements will be entered into, when it is considered that a person is an agent, what constitutes fair dealing.

Speaker 1: 
35:09-35:18
Which forum or how sorry, when it is evident that there's been a breach of contract?

Speaker 1: 
35:19-35:22
And the principles are used in the following way.

Speaker 1: 
35:23-35:30
The principles are used as a way of assisting the interpretation of

Speaker 1: 
35:31-35:32
International law.

Speaker 1: 
35:32-35:41
So they are used as a means of interpreting and supplementing international uniform law instruments.

Speaker 1: 
35:42-35:47
And they are particularly relevant to the sales of goods.

Speaker 1: 
35:48-35:53
They deal with all issues, including remedies

Speaker 1: 
35:54-36:05
And they are uniform, but they are not without obviously well, not obviously, they are not without concern.

Speaker 1: 
36:09-36:20
Therefore, disputes and agreements are subject to these and can be resolved and or litigated on the basis of these.

Speaker 1: 
36:23-36:31
It is possible to do the following that parties agree to arbitrate

Speaker 1: 
36:31-36:36
litigate and decide their issues on the basis of the Unidroid principles.

Speaker 1: 
36:36-36:40
So when we talk about arbitration, what are we talking about?

Speaker 4: 
36:43-36:52
A process where you've got a third party that helps you come to a well, they can make a binding decision, but if the two parties can't make a decision themselves?

Speaker 1: 
36:52-36:54
So is arbitration binding?

Speaker 4: 
36:55-36:58
Well, it's depends on the jurisdiction, I guess.

Speaker 1: 
36:59-37:00
Well, overarchingly.

Speaker 4: 
37:00-37:02
Yes, yes, it's binding.

Speaker 4: 
37:02-37:02
Yes.

Speaker 4: 
37:02-37:03
Yeah.

Speaker 4: 
37:03-37:05
So what is the decision maker doing?

Speaker 4: 
37:06-37:08
Resolving a dispute.

Speaker 1: 
37:08-37:15
Yes, by way of what though, how is it different, for example, to a litigation process or a court based?

Speaker 4: 
37:16-37:23
It's less formal, it's designed for the parties to have control of, I guess, the decision that gets made.

Speaker 1: 
37:25-37:28
Facilitating an agreement, yes.

Speaker 1: 
37:28-37:32
And the parties do the parties have to agree to be bound by the arbitration?

Speaker 4: 
37:32-37:33
Yes.

Speaker 4: 
37:35-37:35
Yep.

Speaker 4: 
37:36-37:37
Otherwise, it's pointless.

Speaker 4: 
37:37-37:38
Then this is the mediation.

Speaker 4: 
37:39-37:40
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
37:41-37:43
Not to suggest that the mediation is

Speaker 1: 
37:42-37:48
Pointless, but the position being that there is a difference between a mediation and an arbitration.

Speaker 1: 
37:48-37:49
Well done, folks.

Speaker 1: 
37:49-37:54
So, if you've got a question, for example, that says that you know, company A and company B

Speaker 1: 
37:54-38:07
or jurisdiction A jurisdiction B entered into a contract for the sale of goods and you've got a fact pattern and then the question says provide advice on measu on methods within or methods

Speaker 1: 
38:07-38:10
that may assist in the resolution of this dispute.

Speaker 1: 
38:11-38:16
One of the methods could be arbitration, mediation.

Speaker 4: 
38:17-38:18
Or litigation.

Speaker 4: 
38:18-38:19
I guess any one of them.

Speaker 4: 
38:20-38:23
Depends if it's going to be ADR or it could be litigation.

Speaker 1: 
38:24-38:26
Now

Speaker 1: 
38:27-38:35
In terms of cases that have been considered, we have the Unilex.

Speaker 1: 
38:36-38:38
Now what is Unilex?

Speaker 1: 
38:48-39:01
Unilex is a repository of decisions that refer to the application of the Unidroid principles.

Speaker 1: 
39:02-39:15
And you see this before you, these are decisions that have used the principles in determining outcomes.

Speaker 1: 
39:15-39:18
So now we're going to turn to a couple of those cases.

Speaker 1: 
39:18-39:21
Now what cases have you come across?

Speaker 1: 
39:33-39:35
Has anyone come across any of the cases?

Speaker 1: 
39:35-39:36
That was one of the discussion points.

Speaker 1: 
39:36-39:39
I noted that there wasn't much happening.

Speaker 1: 
39:39-39:42
On the discussion boards this week, which is fine, that's okay, you know.

Speaker 1: 
39:42-39:51
But I've got a feeling it may be because this is like, well, you know, let's be honest, you're going to read through 14 cases?

Speaker 1: 
39:51-39:52
Maybe.

Speaker 1: 
39:54-39:56
But does anyone come across any cases?

Speaker 1: 
40:01-40:04
I'm getting crazy first year law vibes here.

Speaker 1: 
40:05-40:09
I've been teaching first year law all this week, and some have been on Zoom.

Speaker 1: 
40:10-40:13
And I'm getting very much

Speaker 1: 
40:13-40:18
First year lore vibes here where you ask a question and everyone just goes and hides.

Speaker 1: 
40:18-40:22
So let me let's let's continue.

Speaker 1: 
40:22-40:23
Thank you very much, Graham.

Speaker 1: 
40:25-40:36
As I said in my first years, respectfully, in what context would would you believe that someone would ask a question and no one would answer?

Speaker 1: 
40:37-40:39
Socially, that would be considered to be

Speaker 1: 
40:39-40:42
Perhaps rude, but of course, I know that you're not.

Speaker 1: 
40:42-40:48
So let's focus on trying to get some responses to the questions.

Speaker 1: 
40:48-40:53
Now, has anyone had a go at looking at these cases?

Speaker 1: 
40:54-40:54
I know.

Speaker 1: 
40:54-40:58
Sorry if I'm being a bit I hope I'm not being

Speaker 1: 
40:57-40:58
mean.

Speaker 1: 
40:58-41:06
But I think sometimes, especially with these online classes, it's a bit too much kind of you can do whatever you like.

Speaker 1: 
41:06-41:07
Remember

Speaker 1: 
41:07-41:09
As lawyers, you can really mess up someone's life.

Speaker 1: 
41:10-41:12
So it's really important for us to jump on in.

Speaker 1: 
41:13-41:19
I can't remember the details, but the first one, thirty six, nineteen ninety seven, said the persuasive arguments of the other cases.

Speaker 1: 
41:19-41:21
All right, I'll take that.

Speaker 1: 
41:21-41:23
What forum was it in?

Speaker 1: 
41:28-41:33
The Federal Court of Australia, and what were some of the issues?

Speaker 1: 
41:41-41:42
Anyone have a look?

Speaker 1: 
41:50-41:53
So some of the issues revolved around.

Speaker 1: 
41:53-41:59
The first, I'm just going to pick a couple, and we'll talk about them.

Speaker 1: 
41:59-42:01
And when we talk about them

Speaker 1: 
42:01-42:08
Let's focus on how it is that the principles are applied.

Speaker 1: 
42:13-42:14
Yes, perhaps.

Speaker 1: 
42:15-42:16
Thank you, Grim.

Speaker 1: 
42:16-42:20
So

Speaker 1: 
42:20-42:31
We've got a number of cases, and this one here is the case of Recht Bank, RECHT Bank in Amsterdam.

Speaker 1: 
42:31-42:34
30th of the 4th, 2024.

Speaker 1: 
42:35-42:37
Sorry, 2020.

Speaker 1: 
42:37-42:40
So I'll just talk through the principles.

Speaker 1: 
42:41-42:49
In December of twenty nineteen, there was a US based company

Speaker 1: 
42:50-42:55
They were the company that was claiming.

Speaker 1: 
42:55-42:56
So they are the claimant.

Speaker 1: 
42:57-42:59
And the defendant was a Dutch company.

Speaker 1: 
42:59-43:00
Everyone got that?

Speaker 1: 
43:02-43:04
Different jurisdictions.

Speaker 1: 
43:04-43:05
Okay?

Speaker 1: 
43:07-43:09
A letter of intent was signed.

Speaker 1: 
43:09-43:17
Now this is where we start to get into things like what's a letter of intent, what's a contract, what's a memorandum of understanding.

Speaker 1: 
43:18-43:21
But a letter of intent was signed.

Speaker 1: 
43:21-43:26
So when we talk about a letter of intent, what kind of things are you thinking of

Speaker 1: 
43:26-43:30
Regardless of whether or not you've sort of delved into what it may be.

Speaker 1: 
43:30-43:33
But why would parties enter into a letter of intent?

Speaker 1: 
43:39-43:42
A contract law guarantee for loan, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1: 
43:42-43:46
In this instance

Speaker 1: 
43:47-43:49
The contract isn't ready yet.

Speaker 1: 
43:49-43:52
So, yeah, so what would it be indicative of?

Speaker 1: 
43:55-43:57
Yes, the intention of the parties.

Speaker 1: 
43:58-44:04
Do you believe that on the basis of such a document that it would be prudent

Speaker 1: 
44:04-44:15
or for a party to state, or it may be true for a party to state, that this would guide them into further decision making if one of the parties has entered into a letter of intent with them.

Speaker 1: 
44:22-44:23
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
44:23-44:30
So a letter of intent was signed between the parties that the defendant

Speaker 1: 
44:31-44:40
So the Dutch company would acquire the US companies

Speaker 1: 
44:41-44:42
A stake in the U.

Speaker 1: 
44:42-44:42
S.

Speaker 1: 
44:42-44:44
company's business.

Speaker 1: 
44:48-44:53
The letter of intent set out

Speaker 1: 
44:53-44:58
particular terms or particular methods.

Speaker 1: 
44:58-45:00
So I'm just sort of deconstructing it because

Speaker 1: 
45:01-45:06
The information's there, but as we say, if it's just a matter of saying it's there, read it.

Speaker 1: 
45:06-45:08
Well, first of all, it's not fun

Speaker 1: 
45:08-45:13
And second of all, that's not really, for mine, us talking about stuff.

Speaker 1: 
45:14-45:16
It's just me saying, there it is, look at it.

Speaker 1: 
45:17-45:22
So it may seem that I'm sort of deconstructing this to the point that it's simple.

Speaker 1: 
45:22-45:23
But I'm not doing that.

Speaker 1: 
45:24-45:25
Hopefully, we're doing it so we know.

Speaker 1: 
45:25-45:34
So there's two parties, letter of intent, the defendant agreed to acquire fifty percent of the claimant's business

Speaker 1: 
45:34-45:44
And the letter of intent provided instances that could allow for

Speaker 1: 
45:43-45:49
The parties to say no.

Speaker 1: 
45:49-45:54
For X, Y and Z reason, we will refuse to execute the agreement.

Speaker 1: 
45:56-46:02
The ability to be able to refuse to execute the agreement had a deadline on it.

Speaker 1: 
46:02-46:05
So they entered into

Speaker 1: 
46:05-46:09
an agreement, a letter of intent in twenty nineteen.

Speaker 1: 
46:09-46:18
The ability to be able to refuse for whatever reason to execute the agreement was deadlined

Speaker 1: 
46:18-46:22
to the second of March twenty twenty.

Speaker 1: 
46:23-46:31
If this is what the parties agreed to do, so for some reason the parties said, look, we're not going to go through with this agreement

Speaker 1: 
46:31-46:38
This would attract a fee of thirty million Euro pocket change, folks.

Speaker 1: 
46:41-46:50
Now when the defendant, the Dutch company, failed to sign the transaction agreement, so

Speaker 1: 
46:50-46:57
an agreement between the companies by the agreed deadline.

Speaker 1: 
46:57-47:00
The US company

Speaker 1: 
47:00-47:03
Initiated initial proceedings.

Speaker 1: 
47:04-47:07
Well, if they initiated them, they would be initial.

Speaker 1: 
47:08-47:11
They asked

Speaker 1: 
47:11-47:21
for an order, and they asked the decision maker to order the defendant to take the fifty percent stake.

Speaker 1: 
47:22-47:31
and to pay the agreement amount, which was one hundred sixty nine million Euro.

Speaker 1: 
47:33-47:45
Or, if they fail to do that, to pay the thirty million Euro that was instituted in their letter of intent.

Speaker 1: 
47:49-47:56
So this, of course, was disputed by the defendant.

Speaker 1: 
47:58-48:11
And the defendant said that there were other factors influencing their ability to be able to go ahead with the terms or go ahead with whatever it was that they agreed to in the letter of intent.

Speaker 1: 
48:12-48:17
And one of those was the fact that this was during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Speaker 1: 
48:18-48:25
And therefore, this was an influence on the decision-making process.

Speaker 1: 
48:25-48:28
That was outside of their control.

Speaker 1: 
48:28-48:33
And that so remember, this agreement was struck 2019.

Speaker 1: 
48:33-48:40
There was no indication in December of twenty nineteen that the mess that was to come

Speaker 1: 
48:39-48:42
was indeed to come.

Speaker 1: 
48:43-48:48
And March twenty twenty was pretty much when the world started shutting down.

Speaker 1: 
48:49-48:53
So what they what the defendant said was that, look, we object to this.

Speaker 1: 
48:54-49:00
We never sort of concluded the agreement, and there should be some

Speaker 1: 
49:00-49:04
Change to the feet.

Speaker 1: 
49:04-49:07
And this was decided in a court.

Speaker 1: 
49:10-49:15
Now, this was heard in a Dutch court.

Speaker 1: 
49:17-49:22
The court made a decision about the applicable law.

Speaker 1: 
49:25-49:30
And it dismissed the major claim that was made by the claimant.

Speaker 1: 
49:31-49:37
the US company, and it dismissed on the basis of the following.

Speaker 1: 
49:37-49:43
It stated that there was no enforceable contract that had been entered into by the parties

Speaker 1: 
49:43-49:45
So what are we getting a sense of here?

Speaker 1: 
49:45-49:51
That a letter of intent is, as you stated, an intention.

Speaker 1: 
49:54-50:00
between the parties, or indicative of an intention, but is it held to the same regard as a contract?

Speaker 1: 
50:04-50:13
I know I wouldn't necessarily say it's a collateral contract at this stage, but it it

Speaker 1: 
50:12-50:15
No, I would just keep it as a letter of intent.

Speaker 1: 
50:15-50:20
It does have some formality, and this is the formality here.

Speaker 1: 
50:20-50:23
So

Speaker 1: 
50:24-50:30
That the applicable d the dispute governing law was the Dutch law.

Speaker 1: 
50:30-50:33
There was no enforceable contract.

Speaker 1: 
50:33-50:40
However, there was some sort of decision regarding exit clauses or as you state here, Sally.

Speaker 1: 
50:41-50:41
Is it a memorate?

Speaker 1: 
50:42-50:43
No, it's an intention.

Speaker 1: 
50:43-50:46
I think we'll stick with a letter of intention.

Speaker 1: 
50:46-50:47
It's a letter to be bound.

Speaker 1: 
50:47-50:48
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
50:48-50:52
I think it's a bit more than a memorandum of understanding.

Speaker 1: 
50:55-50:59
So what would happen with the thirty million Euro fee?

Speaker 1: 
50:59-51:00
What do you think?

Speaker 1: 
51:13-51:18
Why would you suggest it's not enforceable, Sally?

Speaker 1: 
51:18-51:23
Why would you insist suggest that they're bound to pay?

Speaker 1: 
51:34-51:37
Like the tunnel rounds in Melbourne.

Speaker 1: 
51:38-51:40
I know I remember the Tunnel Nightclub.

Speaker 1: 
51:40-51:43
I don't know what the Tunnel Rounds in Melbourne are.

Speaker 1: 
51:48-51:51
So the unidroid principles were used as follows.

Speaker 1: 
51:54-51:59
They were used to consider the following.

Speaker 1: 
52:01-52:10
That there is guidance on the basis of law

Speaker 1: 
52:11-52:22
and on the principles to assist in matters of supply chain.

Speaker 1: 
52:23-52:26
Now this wasn't so much a supply chain issue.

Speaker 1: 
52:26-52:34
The court stressed that the transaction fee

Speaker 1: 
52:35-52:37
Cannot be adjusted.

Speaker 1: 
52:41-52:44
The Unidroid principles were used in the following.

Speaker 1: 
52:46-52:59
The court suggested that on the basis of this assessment, the principles would actually support

Speaker 1: 
52:59-53:10
dismissing the payment of such a fee because this was outside of the control of the parties, given that

Speaker 1: 
53:10-53:20
the pandemic was something that did not relate to the provision of service or the decision making process that the parties entered into.

Speaker 1: 
53:21-53:28
So the court, after stating the law applicable to the case was Dutch law, dismissed the claimant's main claim.

Speaker 1: 
53:29-53:31
They said that there was no enforceable contract.

Speaker 1: 
53:32-53:43
Regarding the thirty million dollar thirty million Euro fee, they pointed out that there was no established case law that they could use that refers to matters such as COVID nineteen.

Speaker 1: 
53:44-53:54
And the importance of case law that has specific reference to instances such as a pandemic

Speaker 1: 
53:53-53:59
and its impact on a situation such as the one that they were dealing with.

Speaker 1: 
54:00-54:05
So they said that, look, we have got a body of law previous, we have got

Speaker 1: 
54:05-54:10
maybe a body of law that may come to the fore after this and subsequent decisions.

Speaker 1: 
54:10-54:18
But we don't have anything that specifically relates to this kind of process.

Speaker 1: 
54:25-54:31
Remembering that principles relate to

Speaker 1: 
54:31-54:36
relate to areas such as best practice.

Speaker 1: 
54:36-54:42
And one of the arguments was, well, we don't actually know what best practice is within the context of a pandemic.

Speaker 1: 
54:49-54:57
So, if you're looking at a fact pattern and you can find extraordinary circumstances.

Speaker 1: 
54:59-55:05
You can find reasons for which terms of an agreement may be renegotiated.

Speaker 1: 
55:06-55:17
You can find reasons for which the court may not intervene to

Speaker 1: 
55:18-55:31
impose upon one party to do something, then it may be possible, subject to principles such as the Unidroid principles,

Speaker 1: 
55:31-55:34
To state the following.

Speaker 1: 
55:34-55:37
There is no general international standard on this topic.

Speaker 1: 
55:39-55:52
And as a result, a decision would be made against, in this instance, a decision was made contrary to the interests of the claimant.

Speaker 1: 
55:55-56:03
And there was an ability if the parties wanted to, to reconsider the way that they went about doing business.

Speaker 1: 
56:03-56:07
So in closing, the principles do act as a standard.

Speaker 1: 
56:07-56:12
They do act as a method within which to be able to resolve disputes.

Speaker 1: 
56:12-56:14
However,

Speaker 1: 
56:13-56:23
They do not seek to forge and form a new way of doing situations or working through situations

Speaker 1: 
56:23-56:36
I chose this case because it was novel at the time, given that there were no such examples of a pandemic and its influence on trade

Speaker 1: 
56:37-56:49
So the principles are guiding, but they are applied in a manner in which we would apply all other fact and guideline and or regulatory frameworks.

Speaker 1: 
56:51-56:58
Now next week we'll sort of revert back to admittedly, it's rather ethereal here.

Speaker 1: 
56:58-57:05
Is it fair to say that these decisions also float onto Airbnb agreements and they create new law and influence commercial decisions?

Speaker 1: 
57:07-57:09
In what way would that be, though?

Speaker 1: 
57:13-57:16
How would they flow onto Airbnb agreement?

Speaker 1: 
57:20-57:23
Yes, they're actually yes.

Speaker 1: 
57:24-57:33
I wouldn't say that this would sort of be the direct because it depends on how on what forum and how these contracts

Speaker 1: 
57:33-57:36
or how these disputes were sought to be resolved.

Speaker 1: 
57:36-57:45
But an example would be, do you know how some airline companies weren't willing to give monetary refunds?

Speaker 1: 
57:45-57:51
But they were willing to rebook flights.

Speaker 1: 
57:53-57:56
So what would you suggest an argument could be there?

Speaker 1: 
57:56-57:57
You say Qantas.

Speaker 1: 
57:58-57:59
What could an argument be?

Speaker 1: 
57:59-58:07
What if someone says, listen and I'm not making a lot of it, but I don't really know what's going to happen in like three years' time.

Speaker 1: 
58:09-58:15
What I do know though is that I want my money back.

Speaker 1: 
58:15-58:20
So you can see that the principles, the sort of Ruby

Speaker 1: 
58:20-58:30
The guiding position is that the principles seek to support only what is known and what is

Speaker 1: 
58:30-58:44
what has happened in the past or what could be reasonably presumed to happen in novel situations or in situations where these things have not happened before, it's very difficult for these principles to apply.

Speaker 1: 
58:46-58:47
All right, folks.

Speaker 1: 
58:47-58:52
Hopefully next week we go back to our normal transmission times.

Speaker 1: 
58:53-58:54
Have a wonderful day.

Speaker 1: 
58:56-58:58
Have a wonderful rest of the week.

Speaker 1: 
58:58-58:59
I look forward to seeing you next week.

Speaker 1: 
59:00-59:00
Keep posting.

Speaker 1: 
59:01-59:09
I'll have a look through the posts, and you'll see that I respond in there and keep the chatter going.

Speaker 1: 
59:10-59:12
See you later.
