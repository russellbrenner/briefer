Speaker 1: 
00:00-00:03
What hello everyone, I hope you're all well.

Speaker 1: 
00:03-00:07
You're probably wondering what you've walked into or logged on to.

Speaker 1: 
00:07-00:10
Well, you've logged on to company law

Speaker 1: 
00:09-00:10
So welcome.

Speaker 1: 
00:11-00:18
My name is Nick Nicolopoulos, and we'll be doing what we do here for this teaching period together

Speaker 1: 
00:18-00:20
And I look forward to it.

Speaker 1: 
00:20-00:23
I look forward to your contributions.

Speaker 1: 
00:23-00:28
I look forward to you jumping on in and having a go.

Speaker 1: 
00:28-00:32
and all of the things that come with tertiary education.

Speaker 1: 
00:33-00:36
And what do we do now?

Speaker 1: 
00:37-00:41
Well, a little sort of thing here just to talk about

Speaker 1: 
00:41-00:43
how I would suggest the sessions roll.

Speaker 1: 
00:44-00:52
These sessions are nothing if not built to be interaction

Speaker 1: 
00:52-00:54
interaction based.

Speaker 1: 
00:54-00:59
So I do sort of suggest that just have a go.

Speaker 1: 
01:00-01:05
Now if you don't, if you haven't done all the prereading, well, you'll do it.

Speaker 1: 
01:06-01:09
That doesn't mean that you're absent of voice.

Speaker 1: 
01:10-01:13
If you are not quite clear on something, that's okay.

Speaker 1: 
01:13-01:16
That's why we're here, to make it clearer.

Speaker 1: 
01:16-01:21
Again, that does not leave you absent of voice or presence.

Speaker 1: 
01:21-01:26
Find your voices, have fun, have a go

Speaker 1: 
01:25-01:36
Of course, we will focus on education, but we will also focus on making the best of our time together, so that this is not just

Speaker 1: 
01:36-01:43
One person telling you, but a group of people doing their best to learn together.

Speaker 1: 
01:43-01:47
And you can interact with me on a number of fronts.

Speaker 1: 
01:47-01:51
Number one, through interpretive dance, if that is your wish.

Speaker 1: 
01:51-01:54
Number two, through the discussion boards.

Speaker 1: 
01:54-01:56
Number three,

Speaker 1: 
01:56-01:59
Through emails and all sorts of other things.

Speaker 1: 
02:05-02:18
With regard to the acknowledgment of country, this for mine allows me to acknowledge and reflect upon, as I do with

Speaker 1: 
02:18-02:26
All of the folks that I work with and do my best to consider those before

Speaker 1: 
02:26-02:34
those present and those to come who have established, lived and existed

Speaker 1: 
02:34-02:37
On the land on which we find ourselves.

Speaker 1: 
02:38-02:40
That's what this means to me.

Speaker 1: 
02:40-02:45
And the only way that I can be is authentic with you

Speaker 1: 
02:45-02:52
So whatever this acknowledgment means to you, please let me know how I can learn from this.

Speaker 1: 
02:52-02:56
But you will also see that my push

Speaker 1: 
02:56-03:03
is to be as authentic as possible and not to do things just to say that we're doing them.

Speaker 1: 
03:03-03:06
And this also includes the posting

Speaker 1: 
03:05-03:17
Now I will respond to your posts, and I will do my best to be as responsive as possible, but I will do so with authenticity

Speaker 1: 
03:16-03:20
and with your learning in mind.

Speaker 1: 
03:20-03:28
So if you're reading through your posts and I'm making little comments here and there, I'm not just making those to show that I'm around

Speaker 1: 
03:28-03:38
It's a good way for us to facilitate discussion, especially in situations whereby some students may not be able to come to class.

Speaker 1: 
03:39-03:41
Now how to navigate the unit.

Speaker 1: 
03:41-03:44
These units are set up quite well.

Speaker 1: 
03:44-03:48
You just go through the stuff week by week.

Speaker 1: 
03:49-03:55
Ask the questions, get on the discussion boards, send me an email.

Speaker 1: 
03:57-04:02
As the cool kids would say, academically, hit me up, be in touch.

Speaker 1: 
04:04-04:08
When you come to the sessions, have a go.

Speaker 1: 
04:09-04:10
That's it.

Speaker 1: 
04:11-04:11
Okay?

Speaker 1: 
04:12-04:14
Just have a go.

Speaker 1: 
04:14-04:21
Continue to find your voices in whatever format you wish.

Speaker 1: 
04:23-04:27
And however you wish to do so.

Speaker 1: 
04:28-04:35
So when we talk about how to succeed, really we're looking at the ability of individuals to be able to engage with the materials.

Speaker 1: 
04:35-04:40
And to note if there are any gaps in knowledge.

Speaker 1: 
04:40-04:43
I'm more than happy to chat to you about those.

Speaker 1: 
04:45-04:48
We'll talk about what commercial law is.

Speaker 1: 
04:50-04:52
Is it company law on steroids?

Speaker 1: 
04:52-04:56
And there is a bit of a reflective exercise here.

Speaker 1: 
04:56-05:03
But throughout the session, you will see principles of reflection hopefully exposed.

Speaker 1: 
05:07-05:09
Now, who am I?

Speaker 1: 
05:09-05:18
Well, you know, I could play a six-hour biopic about myself.

Speaker 1: 
05:19-05:23
Which please, yes, Russell, yes, thank you, thank you, Russell.

Speaker 1: 
05:23-05:25
I I do need a bit of support here.

Speaker 1: 
05:26-05:31
And the role of my good self was played by the wonderful

Speaker 1: 
05:30-05:33
wonderful Margot Robbie.

Speaker 1: 
05:33-05:37
This was prior to her forehead into the Barber years.

Speaker 1: 
05:38-05:41
But I won't labor you with that.

Speaker 1: 
05:41-05:46
What I will tell you is that I'm your unit coordinator and I'm also one of the online learning advisors.

Speaker 1: 
05:46-05:53
Now, some of you will also have the pleasure of

Speaker 1: 
05:54-05:59
Hang on, Julie, I'll get to you in a moment, of dealing with Peter.

Speaker 1: 
05:59-06:02
But hang on, Julie, what have we got here?

Speaker 1: 
06:02-06:10
There are five people on another link we used via the collaborate link, not the announcement link.

Speaker 1: 
06:10-06:18
I I I'm not quite sure I understand what that means, but if you can get in touch with those people

Speaker 1: 
06:18-06:27
The collaborate link was bringing you to this page and you will see that every

Speaker 1: 
06:26-06:30
week has got a session to join into.

Speaker 1: 
06:30-06:32
Does that help?

Speaker 1: 
06:32-06:33
No?

Speaker 1: 
06:33-06:34
Oh dear.

Speaker 1: 
06:35-06:38
Anyhow, we shall persist.

Speaker 1: 
06:42-06:53
And this is one of the reasons why I do try and avoid putting links in messages because people click and it may well be that I wasn't as clear as I should have been.

Speaker 1: 
06:54-07:02
But you will also see that whilst the university says make sure that you post with all this information

Speaker 1: 
07:03-07:06
over information sometimes can lead to a bit of confusion.

Speaker 1: 
07:07-07:09
So we'll see how those people go.

Speaker 1: 
07:10-07:13
If you have questions about the unit, let me know.

Speaker 1: 
07:14-07:16
And this session is open to all.

Speaker 1: 
07:17-07:22
I will be responding to the learning groups that I have and Peter.

Speaker 1: 
07:22-07:31
will be responding to the learning groups that he has, and together we'll be forming the basis of hopefully an educational and

Speaker 1: 
07:31-07:32
fun experience.

Speaker 1: 
07:32-07:34
Julie, how did we go?

Speaker 1: 
07:34-07:41
Have we like the Pied Piper, have you brought these folk with you?

Speaker 1: 
07:47-07:49
Oh, look at this.

Speaker 1: 
07:49-07:51
I'm chuffed.

Speaker 1: 
07:52-07:53
Thanks, Julie.

Speaker 1: 
07:55-07:57
Background and interests.

Speaker 1: 
07:57-08:02
Well, you've probably noticed that I'm ensconced in popular culture.

Speaker 1: 
08:03-08:05
Yeah, what link is that?

Speaker 1: 
08:09-08:18
I'll send a message as the famous NXS song says over the next couple of days just

Speaker 1: 
08:17-08:18
Clarify that.

Speaker 1: 
08:18-08:21
So, I've been in academia for almost 30 years.

Speaker 1: 
08:21-08:24
So, this is part of my almost 30-year tour.

Speaker 1: 
08:25-08:29
And my interests, well,

Speaker 1: 
08:28-08:30
Believe it or not, this is one of my interests.

Speaker 1: 
08:31-08:34
So this is a wonderful vocation, and it's a whole bunch of fun.

Speaker 1: 
08:34-08:37
And we learn together

Speaker 1: 
08:37-08:41
The above the line link hub not yeah.

Speaker 1: 
08:41-08:43
Yeah, I feel you, Julie.

Speaker 1: 
08:43-08:46
I'll be sending an announcement

Speaker 1: 
08:47-08:52
My interests while I teach in law and criminology in podiatry as well.

Speaker 1: 
08:52-08:58
So hopefully, we'll have a sort of a mix of views and opinions

Speaker 1: 
08:58-09:10
And we will also focus on making sure that we get through the material in a way that is more than just this is what I know, and you should be in awe about what I know.

Speaker 2: 
09:10-09:22
and more about this is the material, this is its application, and please let me know how I can best help you to get through it.

Speaker 2: 
09:23-09:25
Questions, queries.

Speaker 2: 
09:26-09:28
I will now pause for a drink.

Speaker 2: 
09:39-09:44
Nicole, did you fall victim to the uh

Speaker 2: 
09:44-09:46
The link saga?

Speaker 2: 
09:46-09:48
I certainly did.

Speaker 2: 
09:49-09:51
Welcome, Nicole is our second caller.

Speaker 1: 
09:52-09:53
Our love it.

Speaker 1: 
09:53-09:56
Second caller, welcome Nicole to the secret sound.

Speaker 3: 
09:56-09:57
Thank you, thank you.

Speaker 3: 
09:57-10:04
And it's the worst bit was I was actually I dialed in really early as well, but and now I'm late.

Speaker 1: 
10:05-10:06
That's all right

Speaker 1: 
10:06-10:06
You're here.

Speaker 1: 
10:06-10:07
That's the most important thing.

Speaker 1: 
10:08-10:13
How long are the collabs for commercial law?

Speaker 1: 
10:13-10:15
I also got the wrong link.

Speaker 1: 
10:16-10:25
Uh yeah, yeah, that ten fifteen to eleven fifteen

Speaker 1: 
10:26-10:30
Oh dear, I can feel my student evaluations dropping by the second.

Speaker 1: 
10:30-10:35
Hey, how this job is magnificent

Speaker 1: 
10:35-10:39
for those whose confidence is waning, like my good self.

Speaker 1: 
10:40-10:44
It's the only profession where you are judged by the millisecond.

Speaker 1: 
10:44-10:46
So I thank you all.

Speaker 1: 
10:46-10:48
The expectations, have a go.

Speaker 1: 
10:48-10:50
Do the readings.

Speaker 1: 
10:50-10:51
Have a go at the activities.

Speaker 1: 
10:52-10:53
Post, post, post.

Speaker 1: 
10:54-10:55
Have fun.

Speaker 1: 
10:56-10:58
Oh, look, I do get excited.

Speaker 1: 
10:58-11:02
You know, sometimes you'll think, I wonder what medication he's on.

Speaker 1: 
11:02-11:04
And that's personal.

Speaker 1: 
11:04-11:07
But this is a great job, and I love it.

Speaker 1: 
11:08-11:09
Ask questions.

Speaker 1: 
11:13-11:22
I'll give you my constructive feedback, positive constructive feedback, well I guess and negative constructive feedback.

Speaker 1: 
11:23-11:31
And you do the same and do so with kindness and empathy.

Speaker 1: 
11:33-11:40
And as I will do the best to acknowledge

Speaker 1: 
11:41-11:44
Your personalities, please do the same for me.

Speaker 1: 
11:45-11:50
We don't all operate, think, express the same way.

Speaker 1: 
11:51-11:58
And I'm anything if not absent of a cookie cutter model, cookie cutter model.

Speaker 1: 
11:58-12:01
So if I'm too excitable for you, that's okay.

Speaker 1: 
12:03-12:05
Sally, we'll get to all of that.

Speaker 1: 
12:05-12:07
Ma, we'll get to all of that, I promise.

Speaker 1: 
12:07-12:10
It's a four thousand word essay in ten minutes.

Speaker 1: 
12:10-12:11
No, no, no.

Speaker 1: 
12:11-12:13
We'll talk about that in a minute.

Speaker 1: 
12:13-12:27
But let not the assessments overshadow my heartfelt plea for you all to exhibit kindness and empathy, all of the things that make you the people you are.

Speaker 1: 
12:27-12:28
Now, I know what you're saying.

Speaker 1: 
12:29-12:37
Nick, cut the crap and get to the stuff that really matters because we really couldn't care less.

Speaker 1: 
12:37-12:39
And that is self-deprecating.

Speaker 1: 
12:39-12:45
By the end of this unit, you will know which link to click into to get into the class.

Speaker 1: 
12:50-13:01
You will apply areas of law to factual situations, and you will actually get a sense of topic areas in commercial law.

Speaker 1: 
13:03-13:13
Now I will now spend a boring and defacing three minutes going through every single week.

Speaker 1: 
13:13-13:14
Indeed not.

Speaker 1: 
13:15-13:24
What you will see from the topics for this subject is that we have and I just wanted to use the word at ten thirty one on a Friday morning

Speaker 1: 
13:24-13:32
A pastiche, a collage, an intermixing of topics that come together

Speaker 1: 
13:32-13:41
to exemplify and to provide a practical application of this area of law that we call commercial law.

Speaker 1: 
13:42-13:52
You see, one may ask the question, and that one may be myself, but I do choose to talk about myself with this type of phrasing

Speaker 1: 
13:52-13:56
Is this a distinct area of law?

Speaker 1: 
13:57-14:05
Well, you will see, friends, that it has elements of statutory law, common law, property law.

Speaker 1: 
14:05-14:08
There are criminal sanctions, civil sanctions.

Speaker 1: 
14:08-14:16
So we bring all these things together in a recipe bowl that we call commercial law.

Speaker 1: 
14:16-14:23
And we ask ourselves the question, why does the law have an appetite for this?

Speaker 1: 
14:24-14:26
Why would the log involve?

Speaker 1: 
14:26-14:35
In other words, if you're like me and you click on links of all sorts to purchase things of all types

Speaker 1: 
14:34-14:42
At times where your circumstances are at their lowest in order to make yourself feel better.

Speaker 1: 
14:42-14:47
In other words, online links to buy things because you do need

Speaker 1: 
14:47-14:50
14 different types of blenders.

Speaker 1: 
14:50-14:51
Yes, thank you.

Speaker 1: 
14:51-14:52
Impulse buying.

Speaker 1: 
14:53-14:59
I like to call it buying with a purpose, and that purpose is impulsivity

Speaker 4: 
15:00-15:04
I mean, surely medical treatment is far cheaper than the actual buying itself, though, right?

Speaker 4: 
15:05-15:06
Sorry, Russell?

Speaker 4: 
15:07-15:10
I said surely seeking medical assistance is far cheaper than

Speaker 4: 
15:10-15:12
Purchasing the thing to make you feel better, right?

Speaker 1: 
15:14-15:19
I actually feel, Russell, that the AdFlex and for those that do

Speaker 1: 
15:19-15:33
you don't know the AbFlex was a device that was used to be on infomercials in the late 90s early 2000s that promised that in six weeks you would have the the abdominals uh of a um

Speaker 1: 
15:33-15:35
a a statuesque Greek god.

Speaker 1: 
15:35-15:47
I thought that, that was m was one of the most uh prudent purchases at four o'clock in the morning when I came home uh from a disco, um, sort of sprouting fears of unrequited love.

Speaker 1: 
15:47-15:49
But I do digress.

Speaker 1: 
15:49-15:59
So what we'll be doing is taking all of these things and saying why do we need law about the sale of goods?

Speaker 1: 
15:59-16:03
What do we need to know about international contracts?

Speaker 1: 
16:04-16:10
And what you'll find with regards to matters such as international contracts

Speaker 1: 
16:10-16:13
And excuse me, I don't know why this is happening.

Speaker 1: 
16:13-16:23
My phone usually rings once every three weeks, but today it seems that the scammers are really sort of on board.

Speaker 1: 
16:24-16:30
Why would international contracts form the basis of our cause?

Speaker 1: 
16:35-16:36
Electronic commerce.

Speaker 1: 
16:37-16:44
Now, has anyone lived a life where there was no electronic commerce?

Speaker 1: 
16:45-16:50
I once remember going into a shop and buying a leather jacket.

Speaker 1: 
16:51-16:53
It's don't throw red paint on me.

Speaker 1: 
16:53-16:54
I bought a leather jacket.

Speaker 1: 
16:54-16:56
It was some time ago.

Speaker 1: 
17:00-17:02
Now why did I buy a leather jacket?

Speaker 1: 
17:02-17:07
Because the person who was selling it to me told me I looked very good in it.

Speaker 1: 
17:08-17:11
Now of course, that yes, so Montana, go ahead.

Speaker 5: 
17:12-17:13
I would say that's a very good investment.

Speaker 5: 
17:14-17:18
I've just purchased three leather jackets, and I would say that's a smart purchase.

Speaker 1: 
17:20-17:27
I I was told that I looked good in this, and now, of course.

Speaker 1: 
17:27-17:34
where would most people well, not most people, where do a lot of people actually make their purchases?

Speaker 1: 
17:35-17:37
Can I wear it next session?

Speaker 1: 
17:38-17:39
Oh, how do you like that?

Speaker 1: 
17:40-17:48
Yes, Nicholas, imagine Friday playing dress ups just before I get ready to go to the discos

Speaker 1: 
17:47-17:49
Electronic commerce.

Speaker 1: 
17:49-17:59
And one of the things that we think about in terms of electronic commerce is where would some of the goods be purchased from, do you think?

Speaker 1: 
18:00-18:09
So here you go to store A and you buy a kerchief like this, and I just wanted to show off my kerchief

Speaker 1: 
18:09-18:15
By way of electronic commerce, where could the goods be coming from?

Speaker 1: 
18:19-18:27
Other than some dodgy garage overseas, which may link into

Speaker 1: 
18:27-18:32
What kind of contracts did you are primarily involved in?

Speaker 1: 
18:35-18:37
International sales contracts.

Speaker 1: 
18:37-18:42
So, you start to see how we're going to bring these things together.

Speaker 1: 
18:45-18:47
Are you ready for what I oh dear?

Speaker 1: 
18:47-18:50
Oh, oh, this slide has been cut off.

Speaker 1: 
18:51-18:55
Now, for those of you who like to pop these things into your diaries.

Speaker 1: 
18:55-19:00
and I do, and I don't want to show off, but I do have a paper diary.

Speaker 1: 
19:01-19:07
Our first assessment is an open book sixty minute online quiz.

Speaker 1: 
19:07-19:17
Now, please have a look at the assessment pages and have a look at when these open.

Speaker 1: 
19:19-19:23
And when these close, the quizzes.

Speaker 1: 
19:24-19:25
And it's an individual task.

Speaker 1: 
19:26-19:31
The second is a two thousand word essay.

Speaker 1: 
19:34-19:37
And this is due a Monday, the first of September.

Speaker 1: 
19:38-19:45
And the third is a sixty percent four thousand word assignment, which you are given

Speaker 1: 
19:44-19:47
some time to do.

Speaker 1: 
19:47-19:51
And excuse me just for a second, that date is cut off there.

Speaker 1: 
19:51-19:55
But you will see the you will see the

Speaker 1: 
19:55-20:05
The dates on your assessment tile, that is your assessment work or the assessment section, but hang on a flash.

Speaker 1: 
20:05-20:09
Let me just give you the exact dates there for sense of completeness.

Speaker 1: 
20:15-20:18
And the

Speaker 1: 
20:19-20:20
It opens at nine a.

Speaker 1: 
20:20-20:21
m.

Speaker 1: 
20:21-20:30
on Monday, the twenty second of September, and it's due on Friday, the third of October, at eleven fifty nine p.

Speaker 1: 
20:30-20:30
m.

Speaker 1: 
20:30-20:32
, the final assessment

Speaker 1: 
20:31-20:34
And of course, thank you, Russell.

Speaker 1: 
20:35-20:37
And you, of course, know what happens at midnight.

Speaker 1: 
20:38-20:39
I turn into a pumpkin.

Speaker 1: 
20:39-20:42
So please do your best to submit by that time.

Speaker 1: 
20:42-20:43
Thank you, Russell.

Speaker 1: 
20:43-20:43
Very good.

Speaker 1: 
20:44-20:46
That is less scary as selling.

Speaker 1: 
20:47-20:49
You're talking about me.

Speaker 1: 
20:50-20:51
All right.

Speaker 1: 
20:52-20:54
Questions, queries.

Speaker 1: 
20:58-21:00
All right, let's do it.

Speaker 1: 
21:00-21:04
Now, I understand that not everyone can attend the workshops.

Speaker 1: 
21:05-21:08
But the contribution to the discussion boards is key.

Speaker 1: 
21:09-21:13
So what will happen is with regards to your posting

Speaker 1: 
21:13-21:19
That I will do my best, which means that it will happen barring infirmity and or natural disaster.

Speaker 1: 
21:19-21:22
That when you post

Speaker 1: 
21:21-21:24
I will regenerate your post in the reply.

Speaker 1: 
21:25-21:30
And in color, I will make some points about what you've posted and discussion points.

Speaker 1: 
21:31-21:36
And I'll find that, that for me is an interactive way

Speaker 1: 
21:36-21:48
to address specific areas, to ask for greater exposition in other areas and sets up a dynamic reparte.

Speaker 1: 
21:50-21:51
If that works, let me know.

Speaker 1: 
21:51-21:55
If it doesn't work, just send me an email and maybe you've got some other suggestions.

Speaker 1: 
21:55-21:59
It's a collaborative process, but of course, we're on Collaborate.

Speaker 1: 
22:06-22:11
Um time management

Speaker 1: 
22:11-22:19
Well, it's important for you to sort of keep in mind what it is that you seek to do with your time and how you do it.

Speaker 1: 
22:19-22:22
But I really want to focus on this area here.

Speaker 1: 
22:22-22:24
So

Speaker 1: 
22:24-22:26
What is commercial law?

Speaker 1: 
22:26-22:29
Now we will go through all of these things.

Speaker 1: 
22:30-22:33
And what I would like you to consider this as is this.

Speaker 1: 
22:33-22:37
And I understand that people sort of

Speaker 1: 
22:37-22:38
conceptualize things.

Speaker 1: 
22:38-22:45
And before whatever it is that you think about, whatever it is that I'm going to say, that's okay.

Speaker 1: 
22:45-22:49
I like to think in terms of colors and paintings and things.

Speaker 1: 
22:49-23:01
If I asked you, if I asked you to draw a painting of what commercial law is, to encapsulate, to manifest.

Speaker 1: 
23:03-23:05
what this is.

Speaker 1: 
23:05-23:06
Cubism.

Speaker 1: 
23:07-23:07
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
23:07-23:12
I must admit though, Russell, that rectangle is the rectangle is one of my favorite shows.

Speaker 1: 
23:13-23:15
But of course, perhaps a rectangle.

Speaker 1: 
23:16-23:26
And I say to you that when you are thinking about commercial law, you have a palette of colours, palette of ideas

Speaker 1: 
23:26-23:32
that you will use to draw, to expose, to articulate what you think commercial law is.

Speaker 1: 
23:32-23:37
We have to make these words, my friend, jump out of the page.

Speaker 1: 
23:37-23:43
So for example, we say rights and duties arising from the supply of goods and services.

Speaker 1: 
23:43-23:45
Oh, that sounds grand, right?

Speaker 1: 
23:46-23:47
It sounds amazing

Speaker 1: 
23:47-23:54
It sounds like the kind of thing that if you heard on a first date, you'd offer the person a second date.

Speaker 1: 
23:54-23:58
But our role here is to take these words

Speaker 1: 
23:58-23:59
And to put them into practice.

Speaker 1: 
24:00-24:01
What does this mean practically?

Speaker 1: 
24:01-24:04
So let's have a go.

Speaker 1: 
24:04-24:08
When we talk about the rights and duties arising from the

Speaker 1: 
24:07-24:10
Supply of goods and services in the way of trade.

Speaker 1: 
24:11-24:11
What do you believe?

Speaker 2: 
24:11-24:17
And if your mics are working, please feel free to be renowned and beloved callers.

Speaker 2: 
24:18-24:19
What do you think we mean by this?

Speaker 2: 
24:20-24:21
What does this mean practically?

Speaker 1: 
24:35-24:39
Sally, yes, the right to receive what you've bought.

Speaker 1: 
24:39-24:39
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
24:39-24:43
I guess to prot protect business interests for both parties.

Speaker 1: 
24:43-24:53
Hang on, Russell, let me put you on blast because my of course you'll notice my use of popular culture is just

Speaker 1: 
24:52-24:53
I exude.

Speaker 1: 
24:53-24:54
Go ahead, Russell.

Speaker 4: 
24:55-25:01
I was going to say that I guess protecting the business the legitimate interests of both parties or business interests of b

Speaker 1: 
25:01-25:03
Both parties, it might be why?

Speaker 1: 
25:03-25:04
I mean, consumer rights.

Speaker 1: 
25:05-25:06
I mean, yeah, thanks, Sally.

Speaker 1: 
25:06-25:08
You want to get what you bought.

Speaker 1: 
25:08-25:09
Yeah, I get it.

Speaker 1: 
25:09-25:12
Consumer rights, Russell, you're talking about protection.

Speaker 1: 
25:13-25:13
Why?

Speaker 4: 
25:15-25:17
to create a fair trading environment for everybody.

Speaker 4: 
25:17-25:23
So they can they know that they have a like recourse if someone doesn't follow what they agree to?

Speaker 4: 
25:23-25:24
or what they mutually agree to.

Speaker 4: 
25:25-25:29
And so it it creates a sort of a a fair competit competitive environment in a capitalist society.

Speaker 1: 
25:30-25:35
Look at this wonderful sort of array of colours we have, a fair environment.

Speaker 1: 
25:36-25:43
A right to receive, consumer rights, predictability, quality, certainty, stability in trade.

Speaker 1: 
25:43-25:44
Wonderful.

Speaker 1: 
25:44-25:47
Why do we need certainty, stability?

Speaker 4: 
25:48-25:51
So we can plan for business more reliably.

Speaker 4: 
25:51-25:57
Like so we can make good business decisions that will help enrich our

Speaker 4: 
25:57-25:59
Our personal interests, I guess, or business interests.

Speaker 1: 
26:00-26:00
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
26:01-26:02
Global business harmony.

Speaker 1: 
26:02-26:06
Yes, Sally, Eugene might want to give the White House a call.

Speaker 1: 
26:06-26:08
To encourage, continue, trade.

Speaker 1: 
26:08-26:10
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.

Speaker 1: 
26:12-26:13
You're starting to see.

Speaker 4: 
26:14-26:14
Sorry.

Speaker 1: 
26:15-26:16
Oh, sorry.

Speaker 4: 
26:17-26:22
I was going to ask if employment contracts are are part of are a commercial arrangement with uh your employer.

Speaker 1: 
26:22-26:24
Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 1: 
26:24-26:36
So what you're starting to see is a focus on bolstering confidence.

Speaker 1: 
26:38-26:43
Rights as articulated by whom?

Speaker 1: 
26:44-26:50
Why should you have a right to getting what you've sought?

Speaker 4: 
26:55-26:59
To prevent somebody in a better bargaining position than yourself taking advantage of you?

Speaker 1: 
27:00-27:01
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
27:04-27:05
What about duties?

Speaker 1: 
27:05-27:08
What kind of duties may these involve?

Speaker 1: 
27:12-27:15
Yep, sometimes.

Speaker 1: 
27:16-27:21
How do we articulate what these duties are, folks?

Speaker 1: 
27:21-27:23
What kind of examples are there?

Speaker 1: 
27:25-27:34
Why, for example, when I or someone seeks to purchase something, at what point

Speaker 1: 
27:34-27:36
do my rights accrue?

Speaker 1: 
27:37-27:48
And at what point do the duties of the individual to whom I have sort of entered into a contract with, when do their duties come about?

Speaker 1: 
27:49-27:50
So we've got point of sale.

Speaker 1: 
27:51-27:51
Wonderful.

Speaker 1: 
27:52-27:53
Well done.

Speaker 1: 
27:53-27:54
Well done.

Speaker 1: 
27:56-27:58
Yes, qui.

Speaker 1: 
27:58-28:05
to make the business process straightforward and easy between the seller and the buyer from this country and from different countries.

Speaker 1: 
28:06-28:12
So folks, when you're looking at these things, you ask yourselves the question, why would the law get involved in this?

Speaker 1: 
28:13-28:15
Right, very good.

Speaker 1: 
28:15-28:23
Number two, a regulatory framework through which commercial relationships operate.

Speaker 1: 
28:24-28:29
Now you say here, Montana, setting the standards for lawful conduct.

Speaker 1: 
28:29-28:37
Now who and when I say you, I mean society, who are you to set the standard?

Speaker 1: 
28:43-28:47
So who sets the standard, for example, for a regulatory framework?

Speaker 1: 
28:48-28:57
Could you see a situation where we could say, for example, why don't we let the market regulate itself?

Speaker 1: 
28:58-29:03
Now it's quite a neoliberalist point of view, a little L.

Speaker 1: 
29:03-29:06
But why don't we let the market regulate itself?

Speaker 1: 
29:06-29:10
Now, Sally, you say that laws differ across jurisdictions.

Speaker 1: 
29:10-29:20
And yes, my friends, for all you fans of constitutional law, which I've taught extensively, that is a flex, and administrative law, I hope there are lots of you out there.

Speaker 1: 
29:21-29:23
Australia is a federation.

Speaker 1: 
29:24-29:28
So we have multiple jurisdictions.

Speaker 1: 
29:28-29:31
Who sets regulatory frameworks?

Speaker 1: 
29:32-29:34
What do the regulatory frameworks do?

Speaker 1: 
29:36-29:40
They seek to find a consensus.

Speaker 1: 
29:46-29:51
Yeah, Russell, we can see uniform, self-regulate.

Speaker 1: 
29:51-29:51
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
29:54-29:58
Could it be possible, though, that regulatory frameworks may be too constrictive?

Speaker 1: 
29:59-30:03
So when you're analyzing the problems that we have for the week and reading through

Speaker 1: 
30:03-30:15
You may be able to pick what the regulatory framework is, but remember that all because there's a regulatory framework there, that does not necessarily mean that you have to not

Speaker 1: 
30:15-30:15
Critique it.

Speaker 1: 
30:16-30:16
You may agree with it.

Speaker 1: 
30:17-30:21
You may critique it.

Speaker 1: 
30:21-30:26
Laws which have been developed to deal with mercantile interactions and relationships.

Speaker 1: 
30:26-30:28
Now, what does the word mercantile mean?

Speaker 4: 
30:30-30:33
In like does it mean between merchants?

Speaker 4: 
30:33-30:36
So between say B to B, I guess?

Speaker 1: 
30:36-30:37
Yep.

Speaker 1: 
30:37-30:39
Business to business transactions.

Speaker 1: 
30:42-30:43
Yeah, I know.

Speaker 1: 
30:44-30:46
Ye oldy times, Sally.

Speaker 1: 
30:48-30:49
Now

Speaker 1: 
30:50-30:52
What are we seeking to do with law?

Speaker 1: 
30:53-30:55
What are we seeking to do with law?

Speaker 1: 
30:55-31:01
Laws which have been developed to deal with mercantile interactions and relationships.

Speaker 1: 
31:01-31:04
What are the aims of doing that?

Speaker 1: 
31:14-31:21
I know I'm denying you the ASMR of me sloping a cup of coffee, but I I thought it for the best.

Speaker 1: 
31:25-31:31
Sally states to apply them across all jurisdictions.

Speaker 1: 
31:35-31:42
A nationalist economic policy says Russell, that is designed to maximize exports and minimize imports of an economy.

Speaker 1: 
31:47-31:53
Perhaps traders can have expectations for the trade.

Speaker 4: 
31:54-31:57
What do the laws seek to do, though?

Speaker 4: 
32:00-32:10
give people an expectation uniformly, I guess, like what they can expect going into these relationships and what the consequences are if they reach them.

Speaker 1: 
32:10-32:17
So when you're analyzing our problems and when we're having our discussion, you ask yourself the question, well, what is this seeking to do?

Speaker 1: 
32:17-32:20
So we can use laws to do things such as what?

Speaker 1: 
32:21-32:23
Resolve disputes.

Speaker 1: 
32:23-32:24
Regulate.

Speaker 1: 
32:24-32:26
Provide boundaries.

Speaker 1: 
32:26-32:29
Martina, you state fairness.

Speaker 1: 
32:29-32:35
Do you believe, Martina and friends, do you believe that the law is always fair?

Speaker 1: 
32:40-32:42
All is fair in love and trade.

Speaker 1: 
32:42-32:47
Well, I guess, you know, sometimes those two come together.

Speaker 1: 
32:52-33:01
So I may ask you, for example, during the weekly sessions, or I may make a post and ask you whether or not you actually believe that

Speaker 1: 
33:01-33:10
This law is actually inhibiting trade or facilitating trade.

Speaker 1: 
33:11-33:20
For example, there are specific laws that work towards protecting markets

Speaker 1: 
33:20-33:31
And there are laws that seek to expose and increase the capacity of trade.

Speaker 1: 
33:36-33:40
Free trade agreements, yeah, that's an example, absolutely.

Speaker 1: 
33:40-33:43
Now let's look at domestic and international law

Speaker 1: 
33:44-33:47
What kind of examples do we have here?

Speaker 4: 
33:53-33:55
In terms of commercial law?

Speaker 4: 
33:56-33:56
Yeah.

Speaker 4: 
33:57-34:00
Like I I guess you've got the ASIC Act.

Speaker 4: 
34:01-34:06
I suppose that controls from a government perspective on how business is meant to operate.

Speaker 1: 
34:10-34:21
So a domestic piece of legislation could be a piece of legislation that focuses on the rights and duties of those in trade.

Speaker 1: 
34:23-34:28
It may be the rights and duties of individuals who supply goods and services.

Speaker 1: 
34:29-34:33
We've got international law

Speaker 1: 
34:33-34:36
Such as the Vienna Trade Convention.

Speaker 1: 
34:36-34:38
Thank you, Kawai.

Speaker 1: 
34:38-34:42
Now what kind of things are we kind of looking at here?

Speaker 1: 
34:44-34:53
I mean, for one to say that they follow

Speaker 1: 
34:54-34:56
such conditions and such conventions.

Speaker 1: 
34:57-35:00
So what must a country do?

Speaker 4: 
35:03-35:05
Come to an agreement with another country?

Speaker 1: 
35:08-35:17
Yes, de facto, but in order to say that something is under the auspices of a trade convention, for example, or an international treaty

Speaker 1: 
35:17-35:20
What are the steps in terms of ensuring that?

Speaker 1: 
35:20-35:24
Yes, Sally, be parties to the agreements or be members.

Speaker 1: 
35:24-35:30
And for our discussions here in Australia, that this is ratified at a domestic level.

Speaker 1: 
35:30-35:36
In other words, that's been incorporated in a domestic legislation.

Speaker 4: 
35:38-35:44
Are there consequences for, say, Australia not following their own trade agreements?

Speaker 1: 
35:45-35:58
I'm chuckling, Russell, because this is often an argument or a discussion that I have with regards to in constitutional law discussions or admin law discussions or

Speaker 1: 
35:57-35:59
International criminal law discussions.

Speaker 1: 
36:00-36:01
What are you going to do?

Speaker 4: 
36:01-36:03
Are you going to put a whole country in jail?

Speaker 4: 
36:04-36:05
What are you going to do?

Speaker 4: 
36:05-36:11
Well, the US is still the execution of that particular putative action at the moment, I guess.

Speaker 4: 
36:11-36:12
Sorry?

Speaker 4: 
36:12-36:18
I said the US is testing the limits of what punitive actions can be taken against another country who doesn't follow their trade agreements, I guess.

Speaker 1: 
36:19-36:19
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
36:19-36:21
I mean, wh what do you do?

Speaker 1: 
36:21-36:31
So for example, do you suggest that, okay, now we have a large market power.

Speaker 1: 
36:32-36:36
Country A has got a large

Speaker 1: 
36:36-36:40
Commercial and trade reach.

Speaker 1: 
36:40-36:44
So their ability to influence

Speaker 1: 
36:44-36:51
Other countries around the world is greater than country B.

Speaker 1: 
36:52-36:57
And therefore, even though you've got this international standard

Speaker 1: 
36:58-37:07
If you wish to do business with country A, you have to align yourself

Speaker 1: 
37:07-37:15
with what country A does, because essentially that is the de facto standard.

Speaker 1: 
37:17-37:26
In terms of the push and pull factors that relate to

Speaker 1: 
37:25-37:30
trade may in themselves form de facto standards.

Speaker 1: 
37:30-37:36
This is what we agreed to, but let's be honest, if we want to get

Speaker 1: 
37:37-37:47
purchase or if we want to enter into market A determined by country A, we really have to follow what they're doing.

Speaker 1: 
37:48-37:53
And this has also been sort of argument of neocolonialist approaches as well.

Speaker 1: 
37:53-37:59
Is everyone sort of getting a sense of the types of things that we're going to be discussing in this subject?

Speaker 1: 
38:04-38:10
So you ask yourself the question, we sort of deconstruct these things and we say, hey, hang on a flash.

Speaker 1: 
38:10-38:12
Why is the law getting involved with this?

Speaker 1: 
38:12-38:14
So a couple of years ago

Speaker 1: 
38:14-38:16
I was on Facebook.

Speaker 1: 
38:16-38:20
This is something that your uncles and aunties are probably on.

Speaker 1: 
38:20-38:22
And I saw these wonderful shoes.

Speaker 1: 
38:22-38:25
And I said to myself, you know what's missing from my life?

Speaker 1: 
38:26-38:32
As Cinderella would suggest, I believe it's Cinderella, I'm missing some shoes.

Speaker 1: 
38:33-38:36
So I will purchase these sho

Speaker 1: 
38:36-38:48
So, I, by the way, I didn't tell you that I do say some random stories, but please just appreciate that that's the way my brain works, and I'm not taking away from your learning.

Speaker 1: 
38:48-38:52
And if you feel I am, well, that's okay.

Speaker 1: 
38:52-38:57
So I clicked on this link and I purchased shoes

Speaker 1: 
38:58-39:04
And I chose a lovely camel color without the camel.

Speaker 1: 
39:04-39:09
And the the shoes, well, obtuse references

Speaker 1: 
39:09-39:10
Thank you, Russell.

Speaker 1: 
39:10-39:14
I'll take the obtuse as referring to the references rather than myself.

Speaker 1: 
39:15-39:20
When the shoes arrived

Speaker 1: 
39:19-39:23
They were for two left feet.

Speaker 1: 
39:23-39:30
Now, as a podiatrist, I can tell you that I do not have two left feet.

Speaker 1: 
39:31-39:37
So this company was domiciled outside of Australia.

Speaker 1: 
39:40-39:46
What kind of recourse do you think I would have?

Speaker 1: 
39:46-39:49
First of all,

Speaker 1: 
39:48-39:59
I stayed up all night thinking of a pithy hatchphrase and hashtag that I could use.

Speaker 1: 
40:00-40:04
to suggest that I'd been infringed to the maximum.

Speaker 1: 
40:04-40:07
But what kind of recourse do you think I have?

Speaker 1: 
40:08-40:10
That's what I could do, Russell.

Speaker 1: 
40:10-40:12
I could sort of sell it to someone else.

Speaker 1: 
40:13-40:15
But then again, I'd have to look for someone with two left feet.

Speaker 4: 
40:16-40:18
Oh, no, when the question work

Speaker 4: 
40:17-40:18
The question was more.

Speaker 4: 
40:18-40:19
So who did you buy it from in the first place?

Speaker 4: 
40:19-40:20
You mentioned you bought it on Facebook.

Speaker 4: 
40:21-40:22
You didn't you didn't specify where?

Speaker 1: 
40:22-40:26
Nah, it looked nah, this was a legitimate ad look.

Speaker 1: 
40:26-40:30
The person had some of the greatest looking angles I'd ever seen.

Speaker 1: 
40:30-40:36
Not that I look at angles like that, but the shoe just looked like it would

Speaker 1: 
40:36-40:43
you know, if I wore these shoes, people would be swiping right quicker than I could possibly deal with.

Speaker 4: 
40:46-40:50
I guess that under the ACL, you'd have recourse to, at least from a legislation perspective.

Speaker 1: 
40:50-40:50
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
40:51-40:55
Well, I could definitely go to the section that could provide me with some

Speaker 1: 
40:55-40:56
moral relief.

Speaker 1: 
40:56-40:57
Nicole, very good.

Speaker 1: 
40:58-41:00
Recourse via bank or payment system.

Speaker 1: 
41:00-41:01
Good.

Speaker 1: 
41:01-41:01
Very good.

Speaker 1: 
41:02-41:02
Very good.

Speaker 1: 
41:03-41:04
Refund.

Speaker 1: 
41:05-41:07
What other red course could I have?

Speaker 1: 
41:13-41:17
Sorry, did you say the tribunal?

Speaker 1: 
41:19-41:24
I'm sure in country X they would honour VCAT

Speaker 1: 
41:24-41:24
Application.

Speaker 1: 
41:25-41:26
You're suggesting the seller was overseas.

Speaker 4: 
41:26-41:27
My mistake, sorry.

Speaker 1: 
41:27-41:29
It was an overseas brand, yeah.

Speaker 1: 
41:29-41:30
I'm not sure.

Speaker 4: 
41:31-41:36
And the seller and the seller was not Australian based at all, like they had no Australian presence.

Speaker 1: 
41:36-41:42
They fall under they would fall under potentially Australian legislation because they're doing business in Australia.

Speaker 1: 
41:43-41:45
Sale of Goods Act.

Speaker 1: 
41:46-41:48
Any other ideas?

Speaker 1: 
41:48-41:50
I could write them an email.

Speaker 4: 
41:51-41:55
Yes, you could be very annoyed with them.

Speaker 1: 
41:55-41:56
Absolutely.

Speaker 1: 
41:56-41:58
I could leave them

Speaker 1: 
41:59-42:07
A uh a passive-aggressive review you can do

Speaker 1: 
42:07-42:09
You could report the ad to Facebook.

Speaker 1: 
42:09-42:11
I could report the ad to Facebook.

Speaker 1: 
42:11-42:12
Yes, of course, of course.

Speaker 1: 
42:13-42:21
I could also do and this is the point here, it is very hard to regulate overseas sellers.

Speaker 1: 
42:22-42:33
So what does statute, what do rights and duties, what does domestic and international law, what does a regulatory framework

Speaker 1: 
42:32-42:40
What do all of these laws need to be in order to facilitate?

Speaker 1: 
42:40-42:41
transactions.

Speaker 1: 
42:42-42:47
And when I talk about transactions, I'm not just talking about financial transactions.

Speaker 1: 
42:48-42:53
This law also indicates communication, and that is a transaction.

Speaker 1: 
42:53-42:55
So what do they need to be?

Speaker 1: 
42:55-42:57
They need to be recognized.

Speaker 1: 
42:57-42:58
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
42:59-43:01
Perhaps standardized.

Speaker 1: 
43:01-43:01
Maybe.

Speaker 1: 
43:03-43:05
Multijurisdictional, yes.

Speaker 1: 
43:05-43:06
What else?

Speaker 1: 
43:06-43:07
What else?

Speaker 1: 
43:09-43:10
Enforcement.

Speaker 1: 
43:11-43:12
Ends with me.

Speaker 1: 
43:15-43:15
Enforcement.

Speaker 1: 
43:15-43:16
Enforceable.

Speaker 1: 
43:19-43:25
So, we will I will often ask you I will say

Speaker 1: 
43:26-43:34
That there is vindication in judgments, there is vindication in declarations.

Speaker 1: 
43:34-43:38
There is vindication in asserting rights.

Speaker 1: 
43:38-43:48
You will often read cases where parties will go to courts and will ask the court for a declaration of rights.

Speaker 1: 
43:48-43:53
In other words, they will ask the court to declare what their rights are.

Speaker 1: 
43:54-43:59
There is vindication in that, so we cannot push that to the side.

Speaker 1: 
44:00-44:10
adding to the psychological aspect and to the confidence aspect of commercial law, commerce

Speaker 1: 
44:09-44:12
trade, the exchange of goods.

Speaker 1: 
44:12-44:24
Remember, my friends, and I don't know if there are folks here who love history, but of course, being Greek, I mean, you know, it's all about the history and the present, but I love history.

Speaker 1: 
44:24-44:29
I wrap myself in tales of the past to avoid the present.

Speaker 1: 
44:31-44:33
There was a bartering system.

Speaker 1: 
44:33-44:34
There were trade routes.

Speaker 1: 
44:35-44:38
This is not just a twenty twenty five construct

Speaker 1: 
44:38-44:50
So I will ask you repeatedly, get and you say to myself, I should take my own advice, but what are the legal issues?

Speaker 1: 
44:50-44:52
What are the public policy issues?

Speaker 1: 
44:53-45:04
So for example, are you putting forth a postgram to help me in recouping the funds for the shoes?

Speaker 4: 
45:05-45:07
So that's Project Blue Sky V D I D C.

Speaker 1: 
45:07-45:08
Project Blue Sky, yeah.

Speaker 1: 
45:08-45:09
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
45:10-45:18
Now of course Project Blue Sky was all about trade agreements on the basis of

Speaker 1: 
45:20-45:22
Television.

Speaker 1: 
45:22-45:30
So consumer protection, sale of goods

Speaker 1: 
45:30-45:39
Why do you think credit checks and bills of exchange would form the basis of law?

Speaker 1: 
45:39-45:41
Any ideas?

Speaker 1: 
45:49-45:51
What's a bill of exchange?

Speaker 4: 
45:53-45:58
A bill of goods or a bill of exchange or is it a similar piece of the paper?

Speaker 4: 
45:58-46:01
Like it is it like what you agree to give the other person?

Speaker 1: 
46:01-46:03
Yeah, so it's what Sally says.

Speaker 1: 
46:03-46:05
He builds an exchange alike blank checks.

Speaker 1: 
46:05-46:06
In what sense, Sally?

Speaker 1: 
46:15-46:16
Yep.

Speaker 1: 
46:17-46:18
A written order for sale.

Speaker 1: 
46:18-46:19
Well done.

Speaker 1: 
46:19-46:19
Well done.

Speaker 1: 
46:19-46:20
Well done, Sally.

Speaker 1: 
46:20-46:21
Well done, surely.

Speaker 1: 
46:22-46:25
And why do we need to have them regulate?

Speaker 1: 
46:25-46:27
They're already

Speaker 1: 
46:27-46:40
Up front, on the basis that fees will be paid once goods are exchanged, what happens if these things are not upheld?

Speaker 4: 
46:42-46:44
You have a contractual bridge?

Speaker 1: 
46:45-46:46
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
46:46-46:50
What happens to the broader commercial environment though?

Speaker 4: 
46:51-46:56
Well, if people aren't making good on what they'll sell, they'll pay, then commerce falls down completely.

Speaker 1: 
46:56-46:59
Yeah, stifled, absolutely.

Speaker 1: 
47:03-47:06
Both, realistically or theoretically selling.

Speaker 1: 
47:06-47:07
Both.

Speaker 1: 
47:07-47:08
And Montana.

Speaker 6: 
47:09-47:10
Do you mind me coming off the type?

Speaker 6: 
47:11-47:12
I don't type very well or fast.

Speaker 6: 
47:12-47:12
Look, folks.

Speaker 1: 
47:14-47:19
Sorry to jump on in Sally, but I implore you, if your mics are working.

Speaker 6: 
47:19-47:20
Okay.

Speaker 1: 
47:20-47:21
Please use your mics.

Speaker 6: 
47:21-47:23
All right, because I don't talk very fast.

Speaker 6: 
47:24-47:32
I was going to say realistically, rather than theoretically in a legal sense, but realistically, when you're giving someone a bill of exchange.

Speaker 6: 
47:32-47:40
For goods that you've ordered, you know, you enter a contracting and get something made, and you're importing it, for example, you certainly got all of these paramet

Speaker 6: 
47:40-47:49
But realistically, once you've paid that money and they send the goods, you end up with goods that may or may not meet the standard that you've requested

Speaker 6: 
47:49-47:54
and you may or may not have saleable goods, or you may have to drop the price of the goods.

Speaker 6: 
47:55-48:02
And generally, although you might have protections in place like people to inspect those goods

Speaker 6: 
48:01-48:10
generally, your ability to resolve that depends on, I suppose, your strength in the marketplace and your ability to leverage

Speaker 6: 
48:10-48:13
international trade agreement, whether it be the government or something.

Speaker 6: 
48:13-48:16
But if you're small fry, usually realistically, you lose the money.

Speaker 6: 
48:17-48:18
That's my experience.

Speaker 1: 
48:18-48:21
Sally, do you have a pen or a microphone?

Speaker 1: 
48:21-48:22
Please drop it.

Speaker 1: 
48:23-48:24
Yeah, I'll drop it.

Speaker 6: 
48:25-48:25
Oh, what do you mean?

Speaker 6: 
48:26-48:26
Sorry.

Speaker 1: 
48:30-48:31
Oh, I still lost.

Speaker 6: 
48:31-48:32
Sorry, I might be too old.

Speaker 6: 
48:32-48:33
Oh, I know.

Speaker 1: 
48:33-48:35
It means that you've smashed it.

Speaker 1: 
48:35-48:36
You've crushed it.

Speaker 6: 
48:36-48:37
That is magnificent.

Speaker 1: 
48:37-48:38
Well done.

Speaker 1: 
48:38-48:38
Thank you.

Speaker 1: 
48:39-48:39
Now.

Speaker 1: 
48:40-48:48
These are the types of things that you can articulate on a microphone that you can't do through typing unless, of course, we have the session that goes on for three weeks.

Speaker 1: 
48:48-48:49
And I don't mind.

Speaker 1: 
48:49-48:52
We could have a commercial or sleepover.

Speaker 1: 
48:52-48:53
So let me make this point.

Speaker 1: 
48:54-49:05
I understand that some of you may be in various states not being able to use microphones, but I implore that if your technology is working

Speaker 1: 
49:05-49:07
That you find your voice.

Speaker 1: 
49:07-49:16
Otherwise, the sort of typing kind of thing works, but

Speaker 1: 
49:15-49:16
it's not.

Speaker 1: 
49:17-49:25
The chances that you're going to go into court and the judge is going to say, send me an SMS or a DM are going to be very minimal.

Speaker 1: 
49:25-49:29
And that's usually what's going to happen until we all get replaced by robots.

Speaker 1: 
49:29-49:40
Now I know someone's told you a story that you can do a whole course online and that you can listen to it while you're at the gym, and I understand that and I respect that.

Speaker 1: 
49:40-49:50
But I also suggest to you that the law is not a cause, it's a vocation, it affects people's lives

Speaker 1: 
49:50-50:00
And we have to do the best to find our voice because ultimately, we will be advocating for people who perhaps do not have the same voice as ours.

Speaker 1: 
49:59-50:01
The sermon now ends.

Speaker 1: 
50:01-50:13
But if you do not find your voice, then it's going to be difficult for you to say that you did anything else other than listen to a whole bunch of recordings, which, of course, you can do on YouTube

Speaker 1: 
50:13-50:16
I'm going against the online paradigm.

Speaker 1: 
50:16-50:20
It's only because I care, and it's only because I love you.

Speaker 1: 
50:21-50:21
So.

Speaker 1: 
50:21-50:24
Reflect on the reasons you've come out to this.

Speaker 1: 
50:24-50:25
Write yourself a memo.

Speaker 1: 
50:25-50:30
Well, you can do that, but I want to know a couple of things.

Speaker 1: 
50:32-50:33
Uh AI.

Speaker 1: 
50:34-50:39
Oh, oh, actually, can I just do a bit of a diversion?

Speaker 1: 
50:39-50:42
What do you think about AI and commerce?

Speaker 1: 
50:42-50:51
Can anyone see any links between artificial intelligence and the commercial landscape?

Speaker 4: 
50:52-51:01
And you'd have to make sure the models that are used in that context are very well versed in the legislation, so they follow the rul

Speaker 1: 
51:01-51:06
Ah, Russell, you are a killjoy, you and your legislation.

Speaker 1: 
51:06-51:14
Why do you want to burden such a magnificent technology with constraints and restraints?

Speaker 1: 
51:14-51:16
Let it run free.

Speaker 4: 
51:16-51:17
Like a laboratory.

Speaker 4: 
51:19-51:25
If we want to emulate a human brain and a human environment, then we still have to operate under those same constraints.

Speaker 4: 
51:25-51:27
So why wouldn't a piece of software need to do that?

Speaker 1: 
51:28-51:33
Oh, so I guess, yeah, I feel you.

Speaker 1: 
51:34-51:35
Additional thoughts?

Speaker 6: 
51:36-51:41
Is it possible to say that AI within the commercial environment

Speaker 6: 
51:40-51:46
AI is being used to create images that are not real.

Speaker 6: 
51:46-51:50
So it's creating, for example, you book a hotel room.

Speaker 6: 
51:50-51:55
AI is being used to create a much better looking picture.

Speaker 6: 
51:55-52:03
And when we're looking at the fact that it's a sales contract and you need to know exactly what you're getting, then AI is interfering with that.

Speaker 6: 
52:03-52:06
Same with products and how they might work.

Speaker 4: 
52:09-52:11
That's not really different from one the way it is now.

Speaker 4: 
52:11-52:18
I mean, before AI, there were tools like Photoshop and other photo editing tools that basically enhanced images to make them look better, people with good photo angles.

Speaker 4: 
52:19-52:20
Like it's always been

Speaker 4: 
52:20-52:27
the prerogative of a person marketing the product to make it look as good as possible, like irrespective of whether that properly reflects.

Speaker 4: 
52:27-52:30
I mean, if it's dilapidated and it's completely different from that picture, that's a different story.

Speaker 4: 
52:31-52:32
But that

Speaker 4: 
52:31-52:33
It's still an issue that we had before AI, I would have thought.

Speaker 6: 
52:34-52:44
That's true, but something AI can do now that I think Photoshop couldn't do, if you don't mind me jumping in here, is AI can actually

Speaker 6: 
52:44-52:56
Say, let's say Nicholas, you know, AI can put someone else, Nicholas's face on someone else, and say, This is a law degree, and it's been run by Nicholas

Speaker 6: 
52:56-52:58
And it's not Nicholas at all.

Speaker 6: 
52:58-53:06
And therefore, AI can very easily now you've got Elon Musk selling and spruking all sorts of things that he's actually not selling and spruking.

Speaker 6: 
53:06-53:08
That's definitely something that's new.

Speaker 6: 
53:09-53:10
And

Speaker 6: 
53:09-53:11
you know, are we buyer beware?

Speaker 6: 
53:11-53:15
You know, Tavia, the input emptor on that, that's my thoughts on it.

Speaker 1: 
53:15-53:15
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
53:16-53:20
And Quer, you say runs goods manufacturing process.

Speaker 1: 
53:20-53:24
So you're seeing a situation where it may be more expedient.

Speaker 1: 
53:24-53:25
Thank you, Sally.

Speaker 1: 
53:25-53:26
Thank you, Russ.

Speaker 1: 
53:27-53:32
You're also seeing situations whereby, I don't know if anyone's ever bought a house, but or everyone goes and see a house.

Speaker 1: 
53:32-53:37
Have you seen what like I want to get the photographer who takes the photos of the houses

Speaker 1: 
53:38-53:45
to make me look like a um Dame Tyri Dame Joan Sutherland.

Speaker 1: 
53:46-53:52
Because you you go you see the photo and then you go and see the house and you look at it and you go, is this the same house?

Speaker 1: 
53:52-53:58
Or, if a bunch of 18-year-olds just had a Bucks party in here, who knows why they're getting married.

Speaker 1: 
53:58-54:02
So, there is an element of being able to check.

Speaker 1: 
54:01-54:11
And the thing about AI could be, as you say, Sally, that do you have the capacity to be able to make an informed financial consent based decision?

Speaker 1: 
54:13-54:16
Now what else do we have?

Speaker 1: 
54:17-54:23
And just as a bit of a background, and again, I'm not doing this for Flexage reasons, but

Speaker 1: 
54:22-54:30
I'm attempting to do a PhD, which is as effective as me trying to dye my hair.

Speaker 1: 
54:31-54:37
And I'm looking at the use of I'm I'm doing it in terrorism and the use of technology in terrorism.

Speaker 1: 
54:37-54:48
And what we're finding is that there's a lot of sort of use of artificial intelligence in areas, including radicalization

Speaker 1: 
54:47-54:50
Now how does that deal with commerce?

Speaker 1: 
54:50-54:59
Well, is it possible to create narratives with a distinct purpose of achieving particular goals?

Speaker 1: 
55:00-55:02
through artificial intelligence.

Speaker 1: 
55:02-55:03
Counter argument.

Speaker 1: 
55:04-55:06
We used to call those people copywriters.

Speaker 1: 
55:07-55:08
They would write copy.

Speaker 1: 
55:10-55:18
Counter argument to the argument, does technology allow us to disseminate information to such an extent?

Speaker 1: 
55:19-55:24
So, is there anything that you noticed about commercial law here?

Speaker 1: 
55:24-55:32
I know I'm going a bit outside of the reflective exercise, but when you're reflecting upon these things in the next couple of days, before we meet again

Speaker 1: 
55:32-55:38
Reflect upon what it is that commerce is.

Speaker 1: 
55:38-55:46
Write on a page or whatever it is that you express yourself through song, a list of things that commerce is.

Speaker 1: 
55:46-55:47
Is it a right?

Speaker 1: 
55:47-55:51
Should you have an innate human right to undertake commerce?

Speaker 1: 
55:51-55:53
Is it a privilege?

Speaker 1: 
55:53-55:55
Is it an interaction?

Speaker 1: 
55:56-55:58
Is it party based?

Speaker 1: 
55:58-56:00
Is it contractual?

Speaker 1: 
56:02-56:06
And on the basis of those things, you'll see on a week by week bas

Speaker 1: 
56:07-56:20
That we start to unpick and unpack elements of law, elements of public policy, and then build a situation whereby it's a more practical effect.

Speaker 1: 
56:21-56:29
Now, just to make you aware, and I do this.

Speaker 1: 
56:29-56:35
This week has been a very, very difficult week for me, one of the most difficult weeks in my life.

Speaker 1: 
56:35-56:43
I lost the love of my life, my dog Grace, Lady Gragra, Gracie Pooh.

Speaker 1: 
56:44-56:45
two days ago.

Speaker 1: 
56:45-56:54
And being with you today gives me a reason to wake up in the morning.

Speaker 1: 
56:54-56:55
So

Speaker 1: 
56:55-57:07
I'm telling you this not for the plaudits, but to express to you how important this is, not only to you, but also to me

Speaker 1: 
57:07-57:08
So thank you.

Speaker 1: 
57:08-57:09
Keep in touch.

Speaker 1: 
57:10-57:13
You will get random canine references.

Speaker 1: 
57:14-57:18
And please do email me with your questions and queries.

Speaker 1: 
57:18-57:19
Lovely to see you, folks.

Speaker 1: 
57:19-57:22
If you want to chat about anything, feel free.

Speaker 1: 
57:23-57:29
Yes, yes, anything that takes space in your heart does so for a reason.

Speaker 2: 
57:29-57:35
So have a lovely day, have a lovely weekend, and if you need anything, please feel free to stay behind.
