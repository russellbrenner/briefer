Speaker 1: 
00:02-00:06
Welcome everyone to week three.

Speaker 1: 
00:07-00:10
This week we're going international, okay?

Speaker 1: 
00:11-00:13
We're lining up

Speaker 1: 
00:14-00:16
We're having our luggage weighed.

Speaker 1: 
00:16-00:24
We're being asked if we packed our own luggage, in which case you go through an existential crisis and forget that you actually did pack your own lugg

Speaker 1: 
00:24-00:29
and can only see yourself being on border security or whatever it's called.

Speaker 1: 
00:29-00:31
And we talk about international contracts.

Speaker 1: 
00:32-00:37
But before we do all that, I thought that we would go through the assessments

Speaker 1: 
00:37-00:40
A couple of messages and things from my end.

Speaker 1: 
00:40-00:47
But to begin, if we could, sporting metaphor, if we could open up the batting with any of your questions.

Speaker 1: 
00:48-00:49
That's all right.

Speaker 1: 
00:49-00:50
We're glad you're here, Sally.

Speaker 1: 
00:52-00:53
Any questions?

Speaker 1: 
00:53-00:54
Questions?

Speaker 1: 
00:54-00:56
And is anyone going to rock the Cam life?

Speaker 1: 
00:57-01:05
Is anyone going to join me on the journey of one, which is basically how I live my life, to jump on the Cam?

Speaker 1: 
01:07-01:10
I will, but you can't make fun of my Snoggies.

Speaker 1: 
01:10-01:13
I would never make fun of anything, Russell.

Speaker 1: 
01:13-01:14
I have.

Speaker 1: 
01:14-01:17
I'm too self deprecating

Speaker 1: 
01:16-01:18
to make fun of other people.

Speaker 1: 
01:19-01:21
We'll run through all of that in a mow.

Speaker 1: 
01:21-01:24
And Nicole, that is short for the moment.

Speaker 1: 
01:24-01:24
Thank you.

Speaker 1: 
01:24-01:26
Lovely to see another human.

Speaker 1: 
01:26-01:27
Welcome, Human.

Speaker 1: 
01:30-01:30
Thank you.

Speaker 1: 
01:31-01:32
A couple of things before we do the assessments.

Speaker 2: 
01:33-01:36
Nick, can I just ask you quickly before we go forwards?

Speaker 2: 
01:36-01:41
You posted the link to your discussion for something

Speaker 2: 
01:41-01:47
But I couldn't work out how to open the link in Collaborate 'cause I'm not sure.

Speaker 2: 
01:47-01:51
Is there a is it a recording link that you've posted

Speaker 2: 
01:51-01:54
But it mine went to Collaborate, so that was a beginning.

Speaker 1: 
01:56-02:00
I did it on Collaborate, so I'll just run through that as well

Speaker 2: 
02:00-02:01
Well, yeah, how to open it.

Speaker 2: 
02:02-02:02
Thank you so much.

Speaker 1: 
02:03-02:08
So, thanks, Sally, for all of the recordings.

Speaker 1: 
02:08-02:17
If you click on, and now I'd have to do a sharing of the screen of the actual screen that we're sharing, which is Zoom, it'll break my brain.

Speaker 1: 
02:17-02:22
So if you go to collaborate, click on Collaborate.

Speaker 1: 
02:22-02:25
And you will see a hamburger menu.

Speaker 1: 
02:25-02:27
Oh, no, I can actually do it here.

Speaker 1: 
02:27-02:28
Hang on, a flash.

Speaker 1: 
02:30-02:31
Yes, Ruby.

Speaker 1: 
02:31-02:33
Yes, Ruby Roo Kangaroo.

Speaker 1: 
02:33-02:35
You know, when you start making up names for the pets.

Speaker 2: 
02:35-02:36
I found it.

Speaker 2: 
02:36-02:36
Sorry.

Speaker 1: 
02:39-02:40
It's just about to yes.

Speaker 3: 
02:41-02:42
But it's not obvious.

Speaker 4: 
02:43-02:44
I might as well go through.

Speaker 4: 
02:44-02:44
Sorry.

Speaker 4: 
02:45-02:50
I said it's not obvious, like but once you can once you top left hamburger.

Speaker 4: 
02:50-02:52
It's a hamburger menu.

Speaker 1: 
02:53-02:58
But now Welcome to Man explains things that people already know.

Speaker 1: 
02:58-03:00
And that's what we're going to do here.

Speaker 1: 
03:00-03:03
If you click on

Speaker 1: 
03:04-03:11
This hamburger menu here, it brings up recordings.

Speaker 1: 
03:11-03:14
And then you can access all of the recordings.

Speaker 1: 
03:14-03:19
Now, as we get deep into the trimester or the teaching period

Speaker 1: 
03:19-03:22
Some of the recordings may not appear here.

Speaker 1: 
03:22-03:23
They're there.

Speaker 1: 
03:23-03:27
It just means that you need to filter them according to date.

Speaker 1: 
03:28-03:29
But you'll find them there.

Speaker 1: 
03:29-03:31
And if you have any issues, let me know.

Speaker 1: 
03:37-03:45
Now the other thing is uh regarding the slides

Speaker 1: 
03:46-03:50
Now we'll do this here.

Speaker 1: 
03:50-03:56
I post and I understand different people have got different approaches, but this

Speaker 1: 
03:56-04:07
Whole thing of, and I'm not, I'm just telling you how I roll, this whole thing of hello, everyone, here is this, here is this, here is this, and then all the links.

Speaker 1: 
04:09-04:11
Forty nine different lengths.

Speaker 1: 
04:12-04:14
You know, I don't like it.

Speaker 1: 
04:14-04:19
Obviously, I gave it a link to Bianca because it was something in addition.

Speaker 1: 
04:19-04:22
But

Speaker 1: 
04:22-04:31
I don't link, for example, to the slides because when you get a chance

Speaker 1: 
04:30-04:37
and you look at your modules, it will say workshop week two, see here for slides.

Speaker 1: 
04:39-04:40
Ready?

Speaker 1: 
04:43-04:45
I'm just chatting to the dog.

Speaker 1: 
04:45-04:46
Can anyone see that?

Speaker 4: 
04:52-04:52
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
04:53-04:54
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
04:54-04:56
So that's that's why.

Speaker 1: 
04:56-04:56
And I understand.

Speaker 1: 
04:57-04:58
I'm not having a go.

Speaker 1: 
04:58-05:01
I'm just telling you that

Speaker 1: 
05:01-05:03
if there's something that I need to link to, I'll link to it.

Speaker 1: 
05:04-05:12
And yes, I'll do all the Springboard posts and all that stuff's important, but this catalogue of things where we just continue to email you about things that

Speaker 1: 
05:12-05:18
There is obviously I have to follow process and procedure.

Speaker 1: 
05:18-05:22
I don't go rogue on email

Speaker 2: 
05:21-05:24
Nick, can I just ask though the reason probably?

Speaker 1: 
05:24-05:28
Sally, I was just about to hit a high C note there.

Speaker 1: 
05:29-05:30
And you just cut me off.

Speaker 1: 
05:31-05:31
You cut me off.

Speaker 2: 
05:32-05:35
With regards to your workshop week one,

Speaker 2: 
05:36-05:44
When you do click on it though, it says it's just still got links there, but there is actually nothing there on my link.

Speaker 2: 
05:44-05:48
So that's why I'm probably a bit confused as to where to find them.

Speaker 2: 
05:48-05:50
Sorry, it'd be difficult

Speaker 1: 
05:51-05:52
I don't know why that's there.

Speaker 1: 
05:57-05:58
What happened there?

Speaker 1: 
05:58-06:00
I'll fix that.

Speaker 1: 
06:02-06:03
There you go.

Speaker 1: 
06:03-06:03
How's that?

Speaker 1: 
06:03-06:05
Is that good enough?

Speaker 1: 
06:07-06:09
Sally, I'll fix it.

Speaker 1: 
06:10-06:11
Promise.

Speaker 1: 
06:11-06:12
Yes, absolutely.

Speaker 5: 
06:12-06:14
Yes, absolutely.

Speaker 5: 
06:14-06:14
Thank you.

Speaker 5: 
06:15-06:16
I I did look for them.

Speaker 5: 
06:16-06:17
I felt like a bit of a jump.

Speaker 5: 
06:17-06:18
I know you looked.

Speaker 1: 
06:19-06:20
I ain't having a go, sister.

Speaker 1: 
06:20-06:21
I'm having a lot of time.

Speaker 5: 
06:21-06:22
No, I know, I know.

Speaker 5: 
06:22-06:23
Yeah, I know.

Speaker 1: 
06:25-06:35
So what happens is that all this information, just so you know how the sausage, vegan or otherwise, is made, all this information is prereleased.

Speaker 1: 
06:35-06:40
And then according to what we do week by week, we may go in and change some things.

Speaker 1: 
06:41-06:45
And week one may have been pre-released without me unpublishing

Speaker 1: 
06:45-06:51
So just sharpen those quills and that ink for the poor evaluation.

Speaker 1: 
06:53-06:55
So that's where you'll find the slides.

Speaker 1: 
06:55-06:57
So you'll see modules and I'll have there.

Speaker 1: 
06:58-06:59
I've got a couple of emails.

Speaker 1: 
06:59-07:00
Email me.

Speaker 1: 
07:00-07:01
Even if it's obvious, just email me.

Speaker 1: 
07:02-07:05
You know I get excited when I email you back

Speaker 1: 
07:06-07:08
Now for posts.

Speaker 1: 
07:09-07:11
Hopefully, the posts are working okay.

Speaker 1: 
07:12-07:18
I am trying to sort of put in some personal comments that go beyond

Speaker 1: 
07:17-07:20
And again, I'm just telling about my approach, the go beyond.

Speaker 1: 
07:21-07:22
Well done, Barry.

Speaker 1: 
07:23-07:27
And I'm not suggesting if there's a Barry in here, that this is what I wrote for them.

Speaker 1: 
07:27-07:28
nice font.

Speaker 1: 
07:29-07:33
I'd try and sort of focus on particular things that people have discussed or haven't discussed.

Speaker 1: 
07:34-07:37
If that's too much, let me know

Speaker 1: 
07:38-07:43
Or if you consider another approach, email me and let me know.

Speaker 1: 
07:43-07:44
All right.

Speaker 1: 
07:46-07:49
And finally, the review of posthumous posts.

Speaker 1: 
07:50-07:52
Yes, I do my best and thank you.

Speaker 1: 
07:52-07:56
Just keep me in the loop if you're posting sort of a couple of weeks behind to go back.

Speaker 1: 
07:57-08:01
I guess it may become prohibitive as we move towards

Speaker 1: 
08:00-08:11
the middle to latter parts of semester, that it's just it may not be practical for me to sort of go back and read fifteen posts from five weeks ago.

Speaker 1: 
08:10-08:12
I'm not suggesting that you don't do it.

Speaker 1: 
08:12-08:22
I'm not suggesting that I can't sort of cast an eye over them, but to be able and to sort of be provide that

Speaker 1: 
08:22-08:27
there would would may take me a little longer.

Speaker 1: 
08:27-08:28
Okay?

Speaker 1: 
08:28-08:30
I will make every effort to.

Speaker 1: 
08:30-08:32
I think it's important

Speaker 1: 
08:34-08:40
I want it to be important, but there's also that sort of limitation thing there where

Speaker 1: 
08:40-08:52
if I waited to week twelve, for example, to say to you, well, look, I couldn't make lectures one to week eleven, so now I'm just going to give you all the material in week twelve

Speaker 1: 
08:52-08:56
you would consider that, that would not be the most pedagogically sound approach.

Speaker 1: 
08:56-09:00
Similarly, and with full of kindness and empathy

Speaker 1: 
09:00-09:09
sort of waiting five or six weeks later to front end all your posts and then have that level of detail may be a bit difficult.

Speaker 1: 
09:09-09:11
I'm not discouraging you.

Speaker 1: 
09:12-09:15
I'm supporting you.

Speaker 1: 
09:16-09:18
Ah, thanks, Sally.

Speaker 1: 
09:18-09:21
All right, let's go assessments.

Speaker 1: 
09:22-09:26
Hey, ho, let's go, let's go assessments for all you Prince fans out there.

Speaker 1: 
09:38-09:42
So the this first quiz

Speaker 1: 
09:41-09:44
is on Thursday, the thirty first of July.

Speaker 1: 
09:45-09:48
Repeat, Thursday, the thirty first of July.

Speaker 1: 
09:48-09:49
Opens at nine a m.

Speaker 1: 
09:51-09:52
Okay, excuse me.

Speaker 1: 
09:56-09:59
And please forgive any slurping.

Speaker 1: 
09:59-10:03
And it closes at eleven point fifty nine on Sunday, the third of August.

Speaker 1: 
10:03-10:08
And please remember that at midnight, I become and place your answer in the chat.

Speaker 1: 
10:09-10:10
just in case it's defamatory.

Speaker 1: 
10:10-10:13
But at midnight, I turn into something.

Speaker 1: 
10:14-10:19
Now I do not really have capacity to open or close quizzes.

Speaker 1: 
10:20-10:22
And if you've answered Pumpkin, you are correct.

Speaker 1: 
10:25-10:31
If you have plans that mean that your time can be adjusted, please let me know.

Speaker 1: 
10:33-10:36
So there are ten questions.

Speaker 1: 
10:36-10:42
This is a timed quiz, so once you jump on, you will have sixty minutes to do it.

Speaker 1: 
10:41-10:50
Okay, you can't sort of to my understanding, you can't pause it, go out for a Suba that's a Sublaki, and then come back.

Speaker 1: 
10:51-10:55
Well, you can, but you it will close after sixty minutes

Speaker 1: 
10:54-10:57
You'll present it with one question at a time.

Speaker 1: 
10:57-11:02
You can revisit questions previously that you've responded to.

Speaker 1: 
11:03-11:06
It will involve multiple choice in true and false questions.

Speaker 1: 
11:06-11:10
Please read the questions carefully and answer all questions.

Speaker 1: 
11:10-11:16
The quiz will be based on materials in weeks one, two and three, and this is the benefit of the posts.

Speaker 1: 
11:17-11:24
The questions in this quiz draw upon topics covered in the learning materials and the essential readings.

Speaker 1: 
11:24-11:27
It is expected that you've completed all of this inform

Speaker 1: 
11:27-11:32
Your marks on this quiz will be available after the quiz closes.

Speaker 1: 
11:32-11:38
So when we say closes, not necessarily once you've completed it, but

Speaker 1: 
11:38-11:42
after the closing of the quiz at eleven fifty nine on that date.

Speaker 1: 
11:44-11:48
You can expect to receive feedback for each of your responses

Speaker 1: 
11:47-11:55
Please make sure you have two windows open so that you can refer to the student hub while completing the quiz.

Speaker 1: 
11:55-12:01
Please ensure that you familiarize yourselves with all the technological requirements.

Speaker 1: 
12:01-12:10
And we understand that life is the most important thing that you will do, and that

Speaker 1: 
12:09-12:21
You may be impacted by your lived experience, so please review requests for assessment and what you need to submit.

Speaker 1: 
12:26-12:33
Now I'll wait till next week to then talk about

Speaker 1: 
12:35-12:37
Assess the rest of the assessment.

Speaker 1: 
12:42-12:43
Alvi.

Speaker 1: 
12:43-12:45
Is Alvi allowed?

Speaker 1: 
12:46-12:49
I would suggest if LV is a form of AI, know it.

Speaker 1: 
13:02-13:08
Qualifications for doing this or any other job by asking, but what is L there?

Speaker 6: 
13:09-13:11
I was thinking the same thing.

Speaker 4: 
13:15-13:18
It's a really poor excuse for an AI system that Uni provides.

Speaker 4: 
13:18-13:19
By whom?

Speaker 4: 
13:20-13:21
By Swinburne, they provide it

Speaker 4: 
13:21-13:23
Well, it's it's a product sold for universities.

Speaker 1: 
13:24-13:25
Oh, dear.

Speaker 1: 
13:25-13:28
Oh, the sponsors product is coming downhill.

Speaker 1: 
13:30-13:32
Well, there you go.

Speaker 1: 
13:32-13:34
Now I

Speaker 1: 
13:35-13:36
Annette?

Speaker 1: 
13:36-13:36
I'm not sure.

Speaker 4: 
13:40-13:46
I wouldn't use it anyway because it's largely inaccurate and probably no better for than a Google search.

Speaker 4: 
13:46-13:48
It's good for like

Speaker 4: 
13:48-13:51
giving you info from like say discussion forums on Canvas.

Speaker 4: 
13:51-13:58
But I mean, I guess this is it's sort of it doesn't prov it like steers away from providing direct answers.

Speaker 4: 
13:58-14:01
It's basically a fancy search engine

Speaker 1: 
14:01-14:03
I thanks, Russell.

Speaker 1: 
14:04-14:05
I don't know.

Speaker 1: 
14:05-14:10
I mean, I'm not going to say I don't use artificial intelligence because

Speaker 1: 
14:12-14:19
if you want to know whether a Tyrannosaurus Rex would kill a pterodactyl, obviously you've got AI for that

Speaker 1: 
14:19-14:21
But I don't really use it for other things.

Speaker 1: 
14:22-14:23
Maybe I should.

Speaker 1: 
14:24-14:26
So and that I will get back and find out.

Speaker 1: 
14:27-14:28
Corporations law.

Speaker 1: 
14:29-14:34
Oh, but I may not be able to get back to you

Speaker 1: 
14:34-14:36
By the time of the assessment.

Speaker 1: 
14:36-14:38
I guess I will.

Speaker 1: 
14:38-14:41
Thirty first of July is next week.

Speaker 1: 
14:42-14:44
Yep, I'll go back to you.

Speaker 1: 
14:48-14:53
Now, we've got our question for today, and so that I don't

Speaker 1: 
14:53-14:59
run yet, just lastly, and hopefully we'll get into chatbots and their influence on commerce.

Speaker 1: 
15:00-15:03
I once had a relationship with a chatbot.

Speaker 1: 
15:04-15:05
with the tails for chatbot.

Speaker 1: 
15:05-15:10
This was back in the day when chatbots didn't tell you that they were chatbots.

Speaker 1: 
15:12-15:16
I don't know what Joel Quinn Phoenix does, Nicholas.

Speaker 1: 
15:17-15:20
So let's go through a problem.

Speaker 1: 
15:23-15:26
And let's see the timing.

Speaker 1: 
15:27-15:32
Actually, let's go through some material and then we'll spend the last fifteen minutes going through the problem.

Speaker 1: 
15:32-15:34
That's probably the better way to structure

Speaker 1: 
15:34-15:35
Structure it.

Speaker 1: 
15:35-15:37
So just stand by.

Speaker 1: 
15:42-15:48
Now we've talked about the importance of

Speaker 1: 
15:47-16:01
contracts and really considering how it is that we work through not only resolutions of conflicts, but how we enter into agreements

Speaker 1: 
16:01-16:03
That should say teaching period number two.

Speaker 1: 
16:03-16:04
Apologies.

Speaker 1: 
16:11-16:17
So here we're really looking at elements of, say, a contract for sale.

Speaker 1: 
16:23-16:27
And then considering how those elements would apply actually.

Speaker 1: 
16:28-16:31
Sorry, I'm having some technical difficulties here.

Speaker 1: 
16:32-16:33
Let's go again.

Speaker 1: 
16:34-16:34
Apologies.

Speaker 1: 
16:41-16:42
There we go.

Speaker 1: 
16:43-16:45
So how do we enter into international contracts?

Speaker 1: 
16:46-16:47
And really, what's the binding authority?

Speaker 1: 
16:47-16:52
So if you're in one jurisdiction and a party is in another jurisdiction

Speaker 1: 
16:51-16:58
And you first of all, what is the binding authority for developing a contract?

Speaker 1: 
16:58-17:00
What rules do you follow?

Speaker 1: 
17:01-17:02
Okay.

Speaker 1: 
17:04-17:04
Vienna?

Speaker 1: 
17:05-17:06
Yes, I have.

Speaker 1: 
17:06-17:08
It's a lovely place, Sally.

Speaker 1: 
17:09-17:10
That's a flex.

Speaker 1: 
17:12-17:13
My rules.

Speaker 1: 
17:13-17:17
Yeah, I want the clause yeah, that'd be a great clause in there.

Speaker 1: 
17:18-17:20
Rules to be followed, my rules.

Speaker 1: 
17:21-17:23
Now

Speaker 1: 
17:23-17:24
Objectives, you see these.

Speaker 1: 
17:24-17:28
Let's get into the nuts and bolts.

Speaker 1: 
17:28-17:30
The Vienna Sales Convention.

Speaker 1: 
17:30-17:36
It sounds like a wonderful place where you would go and they'd give you a wonderful lanyard.

Speaker 1: 
17:40-17:49
The convention, the agreement, the convention, the thing to follow, for all you fans of constitutional law, for all you fans of things that work by convention

Speaker 1: 
17:49-17:59
The thing to be followed, the thing that is done, the way we do it, do it for all your R and B fans on a Friday

Speaker 1: 
17:59-18:11
This convention agreement applies to contract for sale of goods between individuals or corporations whose places of business are in different countries.

Speaker 1: 
18:11-18:19
And it applies in circumstances where the parties are, where the jurisdictions are party to the Convention.

Speaker 1: 
18:21-18:30
or where, under private international law, the parties agree that this is what is going to apply.

Speaker 1: 
18:32-18:41
So one of your first point of calls in considering how to sort of go about analyzing a fact based scenario is to consider whether or not this would apply.

Speaker 1: 
18:42-18:55
It does not reply it does not apply to, for example, personal goods, family or household use, sales by authority of law, sales of electricity and so forth.

Speaker 1: 
18:55-18:57
Has anyone bought a hovercraft recently?

Speaker 1: 
18:58-19:06
If you could just let us know and just run us through the I'm laughing at my own quips, you can run us through what forum you used.

Speaker 1: 
19:09-19:12
So how does this go about?

Speaker 1: 
19:12-19:19
Now folks, I ain't sort of going to give you a crash course in

Speaker 1: 
19:20-19:22
in this area from the point of view of what happens.

Speaker 1: 
19:22-19:28
But the executive government so in other words, the executive arm of government will bind a country like Australia.

Speaker 1: 
19:29-19:32
The executive arm of the government binds Australia

Speaker 1: 
19:31-19:35
has the capacity to bind Australia to international treaties.

Speaker 1: 
19:35-19:39
And they went to Vienna and said, oh, you know what, this is a good idea.

Speaker 1: 
19:39-19:41
We'll bind Australia.

Speaker 1: 
19:41-19:42
We'll be signatories.

Speaker 1: 
19:42-19:43
We'll say yay.

Speaker 1: 
19:44-19:51
We shall agree to this, and we shall incorporate this into our domestic law.

Speaker 1: 
19:52-20:04
Then the government, through parliament, incorporates elements of the convention or undertakes mechanisms

Speaker 1: 
20:03-20:08
so that the convention takes effect at a domestic level.

Speaker 1: 
20:09-20:10
We all got that?

Speaker 1: 
20:12-20:15
Are you picking up what I'm putting down?

Speaker 1: 
20:16-20:17
This is key.

Speaker 1: 
20:19-20:20
Mhm.

Speaker 3: 
20:21-20:21
All right.

Speaker 1: 
20:21-20:25
I don't expect the same level of excitement, but is someone with me out there?

Speaker 1: 
20:27-20:28
What year did it happen?

Speaker 1: 
20:29-20:33
Well, Sally, I I'm going to be honest, can someone can someone give me the year?

Speaker 1: 
20:34-20:37
I'm going to say nineteen eighty eight, Sally.

Speaker 1: 
20:37-20:38
I'm going to say nineteen eighty

Speaker 1: 
20:39-20:39
Nod, Julie.

Speaker 1: 
20:41-20:51
So the legislature it will work through the legislature to be incorporated into domestic law.

Speaker 1: 
20:54-21:03
So the executive combined the Commonwealth, but in order for it to be ratified, it has to be ratified through the legislature by way of the law.

Speaker 1: 
21:08-21:11
It may not apply in full.

Speaker 1: 
21:11-21:13
They may modify.

Speaker 1: 
21:13-21:22
They may use existing legislation and add amendments in order to exemplify particular aspects of the Convention.

Speaker 1: 
21:25-21:31
So when we're looking at these international agreements, does that help, Nicholas?

Speaker 1: 
21:33-21:40
it is important because there are various sort of people might be in various stages of things that they've covered.

Speaker 1: 
21:41-21:45
So the executive under the foreign affairs power

Speaker 1: 
21:45-21:56
articulated in the Constitution has the ability to be able to bind the Commonwealth to international agreements and treaties

Speaker 1: 
21:55-22:08
That binding has a certain effect, and when and then a treaty is said to be ratified when it is passed through and passed into domestic legislation

Speaker 1: 
22:07-22:11
in which case it will be applied domestically.

Speaker 1: 
22:13-22:21
Now under the convention, so if you have a fact situation that says that this is governed by this forum or

Speaker 1: 
22:20-22:24
Convention, or what convention could it be covered by?

Speaker 1: 
22:24-22:34
If you are choosing this convention, you would say that under this convention, these are the steps that need to be taken for a contract to be formed.

Speaker 1: 
22:39-22:41
And these are known to you.

Speaker 1: 
22:45-22:52
There has to be agreement, intention to be bound.

Speaker 1: 
22:52-22:58
However, consideration is not an element under the formation of the contract.

Speaker 1: 
22:59-23:00
Graham.

Speaker 1: 
23:00-23:02
Graham, you're having a go.

Speaker 1: 
23:02-23:03
You're having a go?

Speaker 1: 
23:03-23:05
Oh, 'cause I made that comment.

Speaker 1: 
23:05-23:06
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
23:06-23:07
No, no, I'm blinking

Speaker 1: 
23:08-23:09
Why?

Speaker 1: 
23:10-23:15
Because sometimes there may not actually be any consideration that's taken place here.

Speaker 1: 
23:23-23:27
To enable to make it more malleable, more flexible.

Speaker 1: 
23:29-23:30
Parole evidence.

Speaker 1: 
23:30-23:36
Parole evidence means evidence that are indicative of contract law.

Speaker 1: 
23:36-23:40
If has anyone forright into contract law?

Speaker 1: 
23:40-23:47
when we talk about the parole evidence rule where we're saying evidence other than what's written.

Speaker 1: 
23:48-23:51
Commercial convenience, yes

Speaker 1: 
23:50-23:54
So statements, conducts, that's parole evidence.

Speaker 1: 
23:54-23:55
Intention.

Speaker 1: 
23:56-23:57
Well, they're good.

Speaker 1: 
23:57-23:58
So we're giving good.

Speaker 1: 
23:58-24:00
We're giving this flesh and bones

Speaker 1: 
24:00-24:03
They didn't sign a contract, but you know that I don't know.

Speaker 1: 
24:03-24:13
They spoke on the phone and said, Oh, I'm cock a hoop by the fact that you'll be standing over these cravats

Speaker 1: 
24:13-24:26
And the other person said, well, I can't wait to sort of have these cravats and sell them at the football, because I'm sure that the people that go to the AFL will be buying a whole heap of cravats.

Speaker 1: 
24:28-24:32
You say, well, there's no written contract, but there are statements, there's conduct here.

Speaker 1: 
24:33-24:36
Now, if the other party did not know

Speaker 1: 
24:36-24:43
or could not have been could have been unaware, then this may actually shape the parole evidence.

Speaker 1: 
24:44-24:45
It's an objective test.

Speaker 1: 
24:46-24:55
If the other party did not know or could have been unaware of the intent, statements are those of a reasonable person.

Speaker 1: 
24:58-25:01
Not necessarily Q.

Speaker 1: 
25:01-25:08
There are common law principles that will apply in the context of international law.

Speaker 1: 
25:11-25:20
Under the Convention, parole evidence is admissible to add or vary the effect of a written contract.

Speaker 1: 
25:22-25:24
You see here as well, under Article eleven.

Speaker 1: 
25:25-25:29
Now when we're talking about Article eleven, basically we're saying Section eleven, okay?

Speaker 1: 
25:31-25:38
A sales contract need not be conducted in writing or evidence by writing and is not subject to any particular requirement.

Speaker 1: 
25:39-25:41
In other words, why do you think that is?

Speaker 1: 
25:42-25:43
To allow for what?

Speaker 1: 
25:44-25:46
Any requirement as to form?

Speaker 1: 
25:47-25:48
Why do you think that is?

Speaker 4: 
25:50-25:51
Uniformity.

Speaker 4: 
25:52-25:57
Like so just in case it's different domestic jurisdiction, the domestic law across different countries?

Speaker 1: 
25:57-25:59
Yes, maybe, yeah.

Speaker 1: 
25:59-26:06
I know what you're saying about uniformity, but it's also a bit of the a bit of a reverse a rule there, Russell

Speaker 1: 
26:06-26:19
such that someone can't say, well, in our jurisdiction, we do it I don't know, double spaced and again, I'm being hyperbolic here, perhaps, but

Speaker 1: 
26:18-26:22
Times New Roman fifteen, and you've run it.

Speaker 4: 
26:22-26:24
It's not an argument about the format, basically.

Speaker 4: 
26:25-26:32
It's effectively saying if it's in this form, then we agree that it constitutes a valid contract, assuming all other things are met.

Speaker 1: 
26:38-26:44
If it it does not need to be writt written or evidenced by writing

Speaker 1: 
26:45-26:47
And it does not have to be in a particular form.

Speaker 1: 
26:47-26:53
It can be deduced or interpreted by way of the dealings of the party.

Speaker 1: 
26:53-26:56
However, it cannot be fraudulent.

Speaker 1: 
26:56-27:10
So similar to similar to Australian contract law principles where if a party acts in a regular way and this is one of the criticisms as well, um, that you know, it's pretty much the Western world just telling everyone else how things are going to go down.

Speaker 1: 
27:14-27:18
Which, I mean, you know, I wish we had a imagine we had a like a 14-hour workshop.

Speaker 1: 
27:19-27:20
Who would turn up to that?

Speaker 1: 
27:20-27:21
That would be fun

Speaker 1: 
27:21-27:31
you know, and the first hour and then the second hour we could talk about thank you, Montana, I needed that boost

Speaker 1: 
27:31-27:44
we could talk about how this is basically I mean, what are the chances that it's not a criticism, I'm just saying, but what are the chances that a country with

Speaker 1: 
27:44-27:52
Limited market power or limited ability to articulate its market power would take, you know what, I'd like something different

Speaker 1: 
27:52-28:00
And in another country that's got a major market share throughout the world or major economic power

Speaker 1: 
28:00-28:07
influence says, listen, we'll think about that, but if you really want to do business with us, this is how we do it.

Speaker 1: 
28:07-28:14
So we look at whether or not there's a contract, we look at the nature of delivery of goods, which is in Article thirty five.

Speaker 1: 
28:18-28:24
The seller must deliver goods which are of quantity, quality and description required by the contract.

Speaker 1: 
28:24-28:28
And then we ask the question, well, what really dictates what that is?

Speaker 1: 
28:30-28:31
Okay.

Speaker 1: 
28:31-28:38
So contrary to agreement regarding goods, they will not conform

Speaker 1: 
28:39-28:48
So they will not conform unless, in other words, they are conforming if they are fit for purpose.

Speaker 1: 
28:49-29:00
They will not conform unless they are fit for any particular purpose made known to the seller at the time of the contract, except where it would be unreasonable

Speaker 1: 
29:00-29:08
to rely on any representations.

Speaker 1: 
29:08-29:12
I think you'll see more about this when we talk about in the problem.

Speaker 1: 
29:14-29:23
The qualities of the goods must be as articulated and they must be packaged in a manner which shows

Speaker 1: 
29:22-29:24
what they're used for.

Speaker 1: 
29:24-29:31
Fitness for purpose is determined according to the standards of the seller's country rather than the buyer's country.

Speaker 1: 
29:31-29:40
Unless the seller knew or ought to have known of foreign standards, small money versus transport sales

Speaker 4: 
29:40-29:50
Is that the case where like there was New Zealand a seller or something like that or buyer and like they sold the truck that wasn't that couldn't be registered in the country it was sold to?

Speaker 4: 
29:51-30:00
And uh sorry, but the the case that was cited with this one, it was it was like a New Zealand case where

Speaker 4: 
30:00-30:03
There was a a big truck fire in New Zealand.

Speaker 4: 
30:03-30:04
Yeah.

Speaker 4: 
30:04-30:07
Nicholas, w was it like a who was selling the truck to who?

Speaker 6: 
30:07-30:09
And was like a

Speaker 7: 
30:09-30:19
New Zealand dealer was selling trucks to an Australian company, and then when they came over here, they weren't able to be registered because they didn't meet roadworthiness in Australia.

Speaker 1: 
30:19-30:20
Yeah, right.

Speaker 1: 
30:21-30:34
And if you watch on the YouTube machine where they show cars or products, and if they're particularly

Speaker 1: 
30:33-30:36
if they're for a particular market.

Speaker 1: 
30:36-30:47
So for example, they might say, you know, this is designed or this has to meet the standards for Europe or this has to meet the standards for Australia, even though it may be made in another jurisdiction.

Speaker 1: 
30:52-30:53
Examination.

Speaker 1: 
30:53-30:59
The buyer must examine the goods for nonconformity within the shortest period practicable, Article thirty eight.

Speaker 1: 
30:59-31:00
Practicable.

Speaker 1: 
31:02-31:04
So nonconformity is an issue.

Speaker 1: 
31:05-31:09
Do they conform to what was agreed to?

Speaker 1: 
31:14-31:15
Third party claims.

Speaker 1: 
31:15-31:18
What do we mean when we refer to third party claims?

Speaker 1: 
31:31-31:37
A snile in a bottle, or there was a message in a bottle, Montenegro

Speaker 1: 
31:37-31:48
Yes, we go back again a party not part of the contract

Speaker 1: 
31:49-31:56
So the seller must deliver goods which are free from any right or claim of a third party unless

Speaker 1: 
31:56-31:59
the buyer agreed to take the goods subject to that right or claim.

Speaker 1: 
31:59-32:03
So someone is selling something that already has a mortgage over it.

Speaker 1: 
32:04-32:08
Just excuse me

Speaker 1: 
32:11-32:17
Ruby's decided to go on a snefari, Ruby's my new dog, Ruby Nicolopoulos.

Speaker 1: 
32:18-32:24
This is for the recording, just if you want to she's decided to go on a sniffari around the office.

Speaker 1: 
32:29-32:29
Sorry?

Speaker 6: 
32:30-32:32
She probably wants treats.

Speaker 1: 
32:33-32:39
She does, but we have a we have a quite a strict treat based policy here.

Speaker 1: 
32:39-32:44
which is Nick eat Nick eats one, Ruby eats one.

Speaker 1: 
32:45-32:47
And I don't like to eat in front of you.

Speaker 1: 
32:47-32:50
We eat different treats, and I just spoke about myself.

Speaker 3: 
32:51-32:52
Yeah, human dreams.

Speaker 3: 
32:53-32:54
Like my daughter.

Speaker 1: 
32:54-32:57
So a third party.

Speaker 1: 
32:58-32:59
Things get a bit rough sometimes.

Speaker 1: 
33:00-33:01
Pardon the pun.

Speaker 1: 
33:02-33:02
Rough.

Speaker 1: 
33:03-33:04
Third party claims.

Speaker 1: 
33:04-33:11
So you sell something that is already got a finance instrument attached to it.

Speaker 1: 
33:12-33:19
Unless the person who's buying it agrees to take that on, then that would be an issue.

Speaker 1: 
33:22-33:25
Now when is a contract performed?

Speaker 1: 
33:25-33:27
When we have payment, when we have delivery.

Speaker 1: 
33:28-33:33
The buyer must pay the price for the goods, Article fifty five.

Speaker 1: 
33:35-33:43
The obligation to pay includes taking on any steps under the contract or by any law to enable payment to be made.

Speaker 1: 
33:43-33:47
Now this article here

Speaker 1: 
33:47-33:55
basically says that once you have Article fifty four, once you have agreed

Speaker 1: 
33:55-33:56
Okay?

Speaker 1: 
33:57-34:08
Then you need to, or in terms of your role in performing the contract, you need to take any of the steps.

Speaker 1: 
34:09-34:19
that you've agreed to, or by the law, required for the payment to be made.

Speaker 1: 
34:21-34:24
Can't sort of come back then later and say, oh, well, I just thought it'd be by cash.

Speaker 1: 
34:25-34:26
So I'll see you.

Speaker 1: 
34:26-34:30
And by the way, I'm taking a ship because I'm scared of flying.

Speaker 1: 
34:30-34:33
So I'll see you in nine months

Speaker 1: 
34:33-34:36
at which point I'll come and pay you in cash.

Speaker 1: 
34:39-34:40
And delivery.

Speaker 1: 
34:40-34:45
The seller must deliver the goods and transfer in the goods

Speaker 1: 
34:46-34:52
Now keep in mind Article thirty one, we're no place for delivery specified.

Speaker 1: 
34:54-35:02
The seller must deliver the goods on the date specified by contract or within any period of time.

Speaker 1: 
35:02-35:14
Now I don't just want to sort of read through these, but what we're seeing is we're having the same or very similar steps to what we've talked about in the last two weeks

Speaker 1: 
35:13-35:22
So the first step is to establish the jurisdiction so that you see which law is covering this

Speaker 1: 
35:22-35:24
And then you step your way through.

Speaker 1: 
35:24-35:34
Remember, follow not the yellow brick road, follow the property, follow the behavior, follow the decision, follow the parties, just follow.

Speaker 1: 
35:41-35:46
In performing the contract, we also have

Speaker 1: 
35:46-35:55
circumstances in which we have to consider what happens to risk and passing of risk.

Speaker 1: 
35:56-36:00
Loss or damage to the goods after the risk has passed to the buyer.

Speaker 1: 
36:02-36:09
Sorry, loss or yes, loss or damage of goods after the risk has passed to the buyer.

Speaker 1: 
36:09-36:14
Does not discharge the buyer's obligation to pay for the goods.

Speaker 1: 
36:15-36:20
So goods have come to the buyer

Speaker 1: 
36:21-36:24
Or let's go the other way.

Speaker 1: 
36:24-36:27
There is some loss or damage to the goods.

Speaker 1: 
36:27-36:32
The risk has moved to the buyer.

Speaker 1: 
36:35-36:41
That does not mean, therefore, that the buyer can say, well, you know what, I'm not going to pay for them.

Speaker 1: 
36:42-36:47
Then we have preservation as per Article eighty five.

Speaker 1: 
36:49-36:53
Well, the reason I'm not using the word burden because then that oh yeah, burden, okay.

Speaker 1: 
36:54-36:54
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 
36:56-37:01
Delivery means transfer of the property and the goods, not necessarily.

Speaker 1: 
37:12-37:18
Remember, we've got delivery of title, we've got delivery or and then we've got possession as well.

Speaker 1: 
37:24-37:30
And now you're starting to see ways in which performance can be

Speaker 1: 
37:29-37:30
amended.

Speaker 1: 
37:30-37:35
Another thing you need to think about here is additional time.

Speaker 1: 
37:36-37:42
So for example, someone might say, well, look, I need a couple of more weeks for this to happen.

Speaker 1: 
37:41-37:50
A buyer or seller may establish a further period of performance post expiration.

Speaker 1: 
37:51-38:03
And a party is not liable for a failure to perform due to something beyond their control, which they could not have reasonably expected or avoided or overcome.

Speaker 1: 
38:05-38:11
Or at which someone could say you should have taken this into account.

Speaker 1: 
38:14-38:21
The fact that a contract has become unprofitable for an individual does not ordinarily constitute an impediment.

Speaker 1: 
38:21-38:27
So in other words, if you say to yourself, or if you argue

Speaker 1: 
38:29-38:33
Look, this now is really unprofitable.

Speaker 1: 
38:35-38:36
This is not going to work for me.

Speaker 1: 
38:37-38:40
And I didn't realize that costs were going to go up so much.

Speaker 1: 
38:42-38:48
It does not ordinarily constitute an impediment from relieving someone from the responsibility of performance.

Speaker 1: 
38:48-38:50
Jada, you've got frustration.

Speaker 1: 
38:50-38:53
Is this a question about my general state?

Speaker 1: 
38:53-38:54
What do you mean?

Speaker 1: 
39:02-39:07
Let me not um

Speaker 1: 
39:07-39:10
Again, just clarify that a little further.

Speaker 1: 
39:10-39:13
Where the contract can't be performed, yeah.

Speaker 1: 
39:18-39:20
Yes, again, sorry, Jonah.

Speaker 1: 
39:20-39:22
If your mic's working, just jump on in.

Speaker 1: 
39:22-39:27
But post you're seeing if there's a link between what, frustration and what.

Speaker 8: 
39:30-39:37
Oh no, sorry, it was just what you said before, and it just reminded me a little bit of what we went through in contract

Speaker 8: 
39:37-39:42
Sorry, I know that this is obviously a little bit different, but it just helps facilitate that.

Speaker 8: 
39:42-39:45
Yeah, it just helps facilitate that learning process.

Speaker 8: 
39:45-39:50
But you were mentioning something about where

Speaker 8: 
39:50-40:00
the contract can't be performed due to unseeable circumstances, and that just reminded me of when the contract becomes frustrated

Speaker 8: 
39:59-40:06
So I don't know if there's like a link between what you were saying there, or this is just like a new concept.

Speaker 8: 
40:06-40:08
That's all my question is

Speaker 9: 
40:08-40:11
Sorry, folks, jump on in with questions about absolutely anything.

Speaker 9: 
40:11-40:14
If anyone's got a question about whatever, just jump on in.

Speaker 9: 
40:14-40:15
Yeah, that's f

Speaker 1: 
40:15-40:27
So frustration is a point where you're just talking really or just going so slow or you're doing stuff and you just

Speaker 1: 
40:27-40:35
frustrating the other person such that you can say that I am speaking, but I'm just

Speaker 1: 
40:36-40:43
laboring this such that the contract itself becomes frustrated in nature and cannot go ahead.

Speaker 1: 
40:44-40:45
Does that help?

Speaker 1: 
40:51-40:53
Don't just say, okay, so I don't do it again.

Speaker 1: 
40:53-40:56
Is that giving you a sense of how it's different?

Speaker 1: 
40:56-40:59
Because when someone is frustrating a contract, they know exactly what they're doing.

Speaker 1: 
40:59-41:04
Or you're asserting that, yeah, I know you're speaking, thanks, champ, you're champing the other person.

Speaker 1: 
41:05-41:07
You're saying, thank you, I know you're speaking.

Speaker 1: 
41:07-41:11
I know you're doing and you're doing this, you're using air quotes.

Speaker 1: 
41:11-41:13
That's how frustrated you are.

Speaker 1: 
41:13-41:18
I know you're doing what you said you're supposed to be doing, but let's be honest, right?

Speaker 1: 
41:19-41:33
You're taking so long and your behaviors are such that you are causing this contract to be frustrated to the extent that it is not able to go ahead or there is something that's happening here.

Speaker 1: 
41:33-41:36
And you're doing it.

Speaker 1: 
41:37-41:39
That's the way that I see it.

Speaker 1: 
41:41-41:47
However, I just want to just give me another second here.

Speaker 1: 
41:48-41:50
Just to check something.

Speaker 1: 
42:09-42:11
This is within the context of the following.

Speaker 1: 
42:11-42:14
So the contract will be frustrated.

Speaker 1: 
42:17-42:17
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
42:17-42:19
The problem with let's go again.

Speaker 1: 
42:20-42:29
The problem in developing whether a contract is frustrated is to indicate whether or not there's been severe hardship.

Speaker 1: 
42:30-42:44
Now if there is severe yet, no worries, if there is severe hardship, then you can say that it has brought the contract to its knees and therefore it's frustrated and therefore it's absent of

Speaker 1: 
42:44-42:46
Any responsibility to the parties?

Speaker 1: 
42:46-42:47
Yes, sure.

Speaker 1: 
42:47-42:47
No worries.

Speaker 1: 
42:47-42:50
I'm at work too, folks, so that's fine.

Speaker 1: 
42:50-42:52
If you need to go, you need to go.

Speaker 1: 
42:53-43:00
Frustration can lead to a situation where individuals will not have any obligations under the contract

Speaker 1: 
43:00-43:03
But you have to show why the contract has been frustrated.

Speaker 1: 
43:04-43:12
If you're just dragging your heels in order to get to a point of frustration

Speaker 1: 
43:13-43:17
and there is no hardship, then that would be an issue.

Speaker 1: 
43:19-43:27
Then you've got an anticipatory breach, so a party may suspend a performance if they realize that they are unable to

Speaker 1: 
43:28-43:30
undertake their obligations.

Speaker 1: 
43:30-43:35
And if we've got a fundamental bridge

Speaker 1: 
43:35-43:46
that there is some behavior that is fundamental to the contract, and that in itself creates the basis for a break

Speaker 1: 
43:46-43:48
So, just on frustration.

Speaker 1: 
43:48-43:54
In the Australian law context, it is very difficult to prove from the aspect of what is hardship

Speaker 1: 
43:54-43:57
So it cannot be a foreseeable event.

Speaker 1: 
43:57-44:02
It cannot be that it is a poor bargain.

Speaker 1: 
44:02-44:08
It cannot be that

Speaker 1: 
44:09-44:14
You uh you knew of something beforehand.

Speaker 1: 
44:16-44:27
It could be that there is a change of law on, for example, or some sort of force majeure event.

Speaker 1: 
44:31-44:33
And then we've got the remedies.

Speaker 1: 
44:38-44:48
If the seller fails to perform, the buyer may require performance, ask for additional time, require nonconformity to be remedied.

Speaker 1: 
44:48-44:51
A court may grant the seller or any period.

Speaker 1: 
44:51-44:58
So the forum, the court is the court in either jurisdiction that's bound by this law.

Speaker 1: 
44:58-45:04
The buyer may require the seller to perform their obligations unless the buyer has invoked a remedy.

Speaker 1: 
45:05-45:07
And we'll go through all of this in a moment.

Speaker 1: 
45:10-45:19
Now one of the things we need to keep in the mind is the damages and the amount of damages that can be claimed.

Speaker 1: 
45:21-45:31
The amount of loss suffered as a consequence of the breach, including profits, you may not exceed the loss which the party in breach foresaw.

Speaker 1: 
45:31-45:34
and must be capable of calculation.

Speaker 1: 
45:37-45:39
Private international law.

Speaker 1: 
45:39-45:45
Now the question will arise as to the law of which country and its courts is to be applied.

Speaker 1: 
45:46-45:52
This area of law is referred to as private international law or rules of or conflict of laws.

Speaker 1: 
45:53-46:00
Therefore, an Australian court has got jurisdiction in an action on a contract.

Speaker 1: 
46:00-46:08
When the defendant has been served in the jurisdiction or being out of a jurisdiction, has been served in accordance with the rules of the cour

Speaker 1: 
46:09-46:15
and legislative provisions relating to service out of the jurisdiction or has submitted to the jurisdiction.

Speaker 1: 
46:15-46:16
See you all later.

Speaker 1: 
46:16-46:17
Bye.

Speaker 1: 
46:18-46:20
Now basically what this means

Speaker 1: 
46:22-46:31
That the Australian Court will have jurisdiction where the defendant has been served in an Australian court

Speaker 1: 
46:31-46:43
In other words, the defendant has been served in an Australian court and it is known to them, or the defendant is outside of the jurisdiction

Speaker 1: 
46:43-46:57
in another country, but has been served in accordance with the rules of the Court and the provisions relating to

Speaker 1: 
46:56-46:57
Australia.

Speaker 1: 
46:58-47:00
So one company in Australia.

Speaker 1: 
47:01-47:04
The other company also has a presence in Australia

Speaker 1: 
47:04-47:05
Okay.

Speaker 1: 
47:05-47:18
One company in Australia, one company outside of Australia, there are rules that an Australian court will follow as to how to service a company outside of Australia.

Speaker 1: 
47:23-47:24
And Stacy.

Speaker 1: 
47:24-47:28
Now just a couple of comments, because every trimester we get this.

Speaker 1: 
47:28-47:31
People say, oh, he talks too much, he fluffs around.

Speaker 1: 
47:31-47:33
If you don't like my style, that's fair enough.

Speaker 1: 
47:33-47:35
But it is my style.

Speaker 1: 
47:35-47:36
Okay?

Speaker 1: 
47:36-47:43
This one hour, if you have any problems with the amount of time and fluffing around or whatever,

Speaker 1: 
47:42-47:47
write to your overseers to make these longer.

Speaker 1: 
47:47-47:53
We have terms, we have queries, this is the only form of communication we have

Speaker 1: 
47:53-48:00
So we also have to build an interpersonal relationship so that I can mentor you respectfully and you can mentor me.

Speaker 1: 
48:01-48:05
So I say this, and you'll hear me saying it often again.

Speaker 1: 
48:05-48:08
You may argue that I'm recognizing a flaw in my own character.

Speaker 1: 
48:08-48:09
Perhaps I am.

Speaker 1: 
48:10-48:16
But I do not want any unsolicited advice about talking too much or not talking too much.

Speaker 1: 
48:16-48:24
If someone asks me a question in class, I'm not going to oversee it, just so that we can fit everything within an h

Speaker 1: 
48:25-48:27
Okay, I'll use my judgment.

Speaker 1: 
48:28-48:36
And if you're not here, I still love you, but usually those comments come from people perhaps who don't get the thrust and parry of what we're doing in class

Speaker 1: 
48:36-48:39
Well, I know I'm controversial.

Speaker 1: 
48:39-48:41
I'm very controversial.

Speaker 1: 
48:42-48:45
Well, it's not about who appreciates and who doesn

Speaker 1: 
48:45-48:50
I'm just sort of saying that, look, this is how I roll, and it's like my haircut.

Speaker 1: 
48:51-48:58
You know, it doesn't matter how much I drive, any trip to Anatolia will not change what I'm experiencing.

Speaker 1: 
48:58-48:59
So let's look at Stacey.

Speaker 1: 
48:59-49:03
I'm presuming you've read the Stacey problem.

Speaker 1: 
49:03-49:08
The first step is to establish what is the contract of SAIN.

Speaker 1: 
49:08-49:10
It's an international contract

Speaker 1: 
49:11-49:20
And to establish whether or not and I'm looking at my notes as well, so apologies to establish whether or not there's an international contract

Speaker 1: 
49:20-49:21
Ah, very good.

Speaker 1: 
49:21-49:25
We need to look at the application of the Convention.

Speaker 1: 
49:25-49:32
Now we have a contract for sale of goods between individuals or corporations

Speaker 1: 
49:33-49:37
Their places of business are in different countries.

Speaker 1: 
49:37-49:43
We have to look as to whether or not they are parties to the Convention.

Speaker 1: 
49:44-49:49
Indonesia is not a party to the Convention, but Australia is, yes.

Speaker 1: 
49:49-49:52
Now I may not be able to get through all the comments as well.

Speaker 1: 
49:54-49:56
Therefore, what do we do?

Speaker 1: 
49:57-49:57
Very good.

Speaker 1: 
49:58-50:03
We move to Article I, Subsection One, Subsection B.

Speaker 1: 
50:04-50:08
Because this is under private international law.

Speaker 1: 
50:08-50:14
So when you are interpreting a contract made in a foreign country

Speaker 1: 
50:13-50:21
The applicable law is the law to which the parties intended to be applied, but tend to be applied.

Speaker 1: 
50:21-50:32
The proper law, therefore, is the law that is used to make the contract and to deal with all of those things that are involved in commerce.

Speaker 1: 
50:33-50:36
As per Bonnython versus the Commonwealth.

Speaker 1: 
50:37-50:39
The parties, let's look.

Speaker 1: 
50:39-50:41
Do we have any indication of what they've agreed to here?

Speaker 1: 
50:41-50:43
Can anyone tell me?

Speaker 1: 
50:43-50:45
Have they agreed to a particular forum?

Speaker 1: 
50:53-50:56
Where the parties have not made an express choice.

Speaker 1: 
50:57-50:58
No, yeah.

Speaker 1: 
50:59-51:02
There's nothing on the facts that says that they've agreed to a particular forum.

Speaker 1: 
51:02-51:03
So what do we do?

Speaker 1: 
51:04-51:07
Where the parties have not expressed a choice

Speaker 1: 
51:07-51:18
Then we look at the terms of the contract as per the Amendment Received Shipping Corporation case in Kuwait Insurance.

Speaker 1: 
51:18-51:19
Was someone going to say something?

Speaker 4: 
51:20-51:29
I was just going to say that yes, I made an area earlier saying that Indonesia was a contracting party, and given they're not, I guess, only domestic law would likely apply.

Speaker 1: 
51:29-51:34
Oh, well, yeah, I mean, this is part of the initial sort of trawling through the information.

Speaker 1: 
51:36-51:39
Let's have a look at

Speaker 1: 
51:38-51:39
The following.

Speaker 1: 
51:40-51:47
We will look at the contract, therefore, and we will interpret whether the parties have

Speaker 1: 
51:48-51:56
Through expressed terms or through the behaviour

Speaker 1: 
51:55-51:59
indicated an intention, a common intention.

Speaker 1: 
52:00-52:02
I'm doing things that we do in Australia.

Speaker 1: 
52:03-52:09
I'm doing things in Indonesia that are in keeping with Australian commercial law as well

Speaker 1: 
52:09-52:20
Oh, therefore, through your intentions, through your implication uh by implication, or even expressly

Speaker 1: 
52:19-52:24
you have evinced a common intention.

Speaker 1: 
52:24-52:28
When we are talking about events, you have put forth

Speaker 1: 
52:28-52:32
It is evident through your behaviour.

Speaker 1: 
52:32-52:38
It is evident by what you are doing, Stacey and Rugseller.

Speaker 1: 
52:39-52:47
Oh, actually, sorry, Stacey and Greg, that this is what you presume to do.

Speaker 1: 
52:47-52:50
So where has the contract been made?

Speaker 1: 
52:50-52:53
This is the first question you need to ask yourself.

Speaker 1: 
52:53-52:58
Where does the contract have its closest and real connection?

Speaker 1: 
53:01-53:03
When you revisit this, think of these questions.

Speaker 1: 
53:04-53:08
Which country has the most significant relationship to the transaction?

Speaker 1: 
53:10-53:12
Very good.

Speaker 1: 
53:12-53:14
Where is the contract to be performed?

Speaker 1: 
53:16-53:17
Australia.

Speaker 1: 
53:18-53:19
Australia.

Speaker 1: 
53:20-53:24
Given the facts, arguably Australia.

Speaker 1: 
53:24-53:26
Stacy contacted Gregg.

Speaker 1: 
53:27-53:29
The goods are being shipped into Australia.

Speaker 1: 
53:30-53:32
They're for sale in Australia.

Speaker 1: 
53:33-53:39
She could argue that it was made in Australia and therefore Australian law ought to govern.

Speaker 1: 
53:41-53:45
There's no choice being indicated in the facts.

Speaker 1: 
53:48-53:58
If there's a dispute, then there may be a case for arbitration under the Convention.

Speaker 1: 
54:01-54:09
So Stacey may say, well, Australia is a signatory to the Vienna Convention, and the Vienna Convention, therefore

Speaker 1: 
54:08-54:15
allows for me to seek arbitr for me to seek for there to be arbitration for us to decide the forum.

Speaker 1: 
54:18-54:23
Well, Graham, if Indonesia simply says bugger off, then that's what Indonesia says.

Speaker 1: 
54:23-54:27
And that's one of the that's one of the

Speaker 1: 
54:26-54:28
the discussion points.

Speaker 1: 
54:28-54:38
So the fact of the matter is this, that these conventions, I guess, work by the fact that if enough people use them, it becomes a standard

Speaker 1: 
54:37-54:48
And by becoming a standard, there is a certain sort of body, a body of remedies, a body of support, a body of signatories.

Speaker 1: 
54:47-55:00
So if you look at the United States of America or a big sort of economy, a massive economy, right, that says that you will only do business with us if you do this, this and the other.

Speaker 1: 
55:02-55:07
And by becoming a standard, it offers a form of protection.

Speaker 1: 
55:07-55:14
But ultimately, yes, it's not the case they could just say, see ya, not interested.

Speaker 1: 
55:15-55:19
Thus, it's likely that we have an international contract for sale and the convention applies.

Speaker 1: 
55:20-55:22
There could be arguments saying that the contract is made in Indonesia.

Speaker 1: 
55:23-55:24
We'd hear both.

Speaker 1: 
55:25-55:31
There's been acceptance in Indonesia, the goods were manufactured there, and Greg is based there.

Speaker 1: 
55:34-55:37
Well, this is what we're talking about, the proper law to apply.

Speaker 1: 
55:39-55:42
So the term proper law is the law that we applied.

Speaker 1: 
55:43-55:49
So we're looking at where the contract was made and where the close connection is.

Speaker 1: 
55:49-55:52
Some may argue Australia, some otherwise.

Speaker 1: 
55:54-55:58
Does the parole evidence rule if you need to go, go.

Speaker 1: 
55:58-56:00
This is being recorded.

Speaker 1: 
56:00-56:05
Does the parole evidence rule operate with regards to e mail correspondence and so forth?

Speaker 1: 
56:07-56:18
Under the common law in Australia, the parole evidence may not be admitted to add or vary the effect of a contract that is written in nature.

Speaker 1: 
56:20-56:28
If the parties intended for that original contract to be the be all

Speaker 1: 
56:28-56:35
Now this is not legal terms, and end all a complete record of their agreement.

Speaker 1: 
56:36-56:41
However, the Convention does allow this

Speaker 1: 
56:41-56:43
In certain circumstances.

Speaker 1: 
56:48-56:49
So

Speaker 1: 
56:48-56:53
The Vienna Convention requires us to look at the subjective intent of the parties.

Speaker 1: 
56:53-56:54
What did they intend to do?

Speaker 1: 
56:55-56:56
What do their statements indicate?

Speaker 1: 
56:57-56:58
What does their contact show?

Speaker 1: 
57:01-57:14
Now the Barol evidence rule does not operate with respect to the e mail correspondence as the details regarding the variety

Speaker 1: 
57:17-57:23
are contained in each monthly order and are not expressed in the actual agreement.

Speaker 1: 
57:24-57:33
Stacy is advised to retain the emails, and they should produce an evidence in the case that

Speaker 1: 
57:33-57:38
the subsequent agreements are not made out.

Speaker 1: 
57:38-57:47
So again, it seems likely that the parole evidence rule may not operate with respect to the e-mail correspondence

Speaker 1: 
57:49-58:01
Because they have numerous e mails detailing the contractual agreement, sending a considerable amount spending a considerable amount of time and so forth

Speaker 1: 
58:01-58:05
Stacey and Gregg signed a finalise agreement, which is for the provision of 100 rugs per month.

Speaker 1: 
58:05-58:08
That is the agreement, 100 rugs per month.

Speaker 1: 
58:13-58:20
So they will say, Well, you've signed the agreement subsequent to the emails.

Speaker 1: 
58:21-58:29
Conforming, the goods must also comply with the quality and quantity and description as this happened.

Speaker 1: 
58:31-58:37
Now, the facts do not state how the goods were described outside of the emails.

Speaker 1: 
58:39-58:45
Only a hundred rugs per month for the next three years at that price.

Speaker 1: 
58:47-58:54
Stacy that he will sell and select only the finest of his stock.

Speaker 1: 
58:56-58:58
So again

Speaker 1: 
58:58-59:07
When she is adducing evidence, she will show the emails in the following context

Speaker 1: 
59:08-59:11
This is what Greg said.

Speaker 1: 
59:11-59:20
I am showing that these rugs are not of the finest quality.

Speaker 1: 
59:25-59:27
Did Stacy wait too long?

Speaker 1: 
59:27-59:29
Now, let's look at examination of good

Speaker 1: 
59:30-59:37
The buyer must examine the goods for non-conformity within the shortest period of time, as per Article 38, subsection 1.

Speaker 1: 
59:39-59:42
She may have waited too long.

Speaker 1: 
59:42-59:46
She should have examined the goods immediately or as soon as practicable.

Speaker 1: 
59:47-59:49
Now what type of goods are these?

Speaker 1: 
59:50-59:56
That will determine the basis of whether or not this is practical and reasonable.

Speaker 1: 
59:57-01:00:08
The fact that she may not have examined the goods within a reasonable period of time does not affect her ability to recover damages per se.

Speaker 1: 
01:00:10-01:00:15
if the goods are not of the quality that they should have been.

Speaker 1: 
01:00:16-01:00:19
It just does not allow her

Speaker 1: 
01:00:19-01:00:25
to suggest that there's been some issue with that part of the contract.

Speaker 1: 
01:00:27-01:00:31
She is a buyer

Speaker 1: 
01:00:31-01:00:35
Greg is the seller here.

Speaker 1: 
01:00:35-01:00:39
So you will look for remedies that extend

Speaker 1: 
01:00:40-01:00:44
or apply to the buyer with regards to the seller.

Speaker 1: 
01:00:47-01:00:50
Russell

Speaker 1: 
01:00:50-01:00:54
Yes, I would I would just I know you're asking about the ACL.

Speaker 1: 
01:00:56-01:01:00
Acceptable quality applied presuming domestic law applies.

Speaker 1: 
01:01:00-01:01:03
No, we're applying a Vienna Convention here.

Speaker 1: 
01:01:04-01:01:06
So you would not use the ACL?

Speaker 4: 
01:01:09-01:01:13
What I was asking actually is because

Speaker 4: 
01:01:13-01:01:20
In this particular scenario, like where we're talking about jurisdiction and where which local laws or common laws would apply

Speaker 4: 
01:01:20-01:01:21
to this particular transaction.

Speaker 4: 
01:01:22-01:01:23
And that's where I was going with my thinking.

Speaker 4: 
01:01:23-01:01:26
I understand that it's the Vienna Commission that's applied to.

Speaker 4: 
01:01:29-01:01:30
Right.

Speaker 1: 
01:01:30-01:01:33
If both parties were not sold in Australia and there was no BNA convention.

Speaker 1: 
01:01:34-01:01:34
Right.

Speaker 1: 
01:01:35-01:01:37
So is that the nature of the question?

Speaker 4: 
01:01:38-01:01:39
Well, not really.

Speaker 4: 
01:01:39-01:01:42
We were talking before about, like I say, if

Speaker 4: 
01:01:42-01:01:48
The V like if the if the so this is outside the CSIC or is it still part of the the same thing we're talking about here?

Speaker 1: 
01:01:48-01:01:50
No, we're using the Vienna convention.

Speaker 4: 
01:01:50-01:01:51
Right, right.

Speaker 1: 
01:01:53-01:01:59
We've already made a determination in the beginning that this would be the proper law to be used.

Speaker 4: 
01:01:59-01:02:00
Right.

Speaker 1: 
01:02:00-01:02:02
And then we're applying it.

Speaker 1: 
01:02:04-01:02:06
I'll come to your question in a second, Julie.

Speaker 1: 
01:02:06-01:02:09
Are the buyer's remedies for breach by the seller?

Speaker 1: 
01:02:09-01:02:13
You could have damages, you could rescind the contract

Speaker 1: 
01:02:12-01:02:15
And that would be the most appropriate remedies for Stacy.

Speaker 1: 
01:02:15-01:02:20
But remember that rescinding the contract means that if she's received the goods, she cannot keep them.

Speaker 1: 
01:02:23-01:02:26
Julie, the nature of your question, go ahead.

Speaker 6: 
01:02:36-01:02:37
Okay.

Speaker 6: 
01:02:37-01:02:42
Does quality fall under the definition of fitness for purpose?

Speaker 6: 
01:02:42-01:02:46
Or is fitness for purpose more about

Speaker 6: 
01:02:46-01:02:54
What it says, like purpose, like you know, it's still a rug, it still works as a rug, but

Speaker 1: 
01:02:54-01:02:56
It's just a crap rug.

Speaker 6: 
01:02:56-01:03:06
Yeah, like if it if it's just a crap rug, it still still fits the purpose and therefore she's the s buyer, not the seller.

Speaker 1: 
01:03:08-01:03:10
Ah, yes, Jada, Timu.

Speaker 1: 
01:03:10-01:03:16
So the seller must deliver goods which are of quantity, quality and description required by the contract.

Speaker 1: 
01:03:17-01:03:21
So if she can argue that that has not occurred

Speaker 1: 
01:03:21-01:03:25
then there may be a basis for action.

Speaker 1: 
01:03:26-01:03:27
Does that help?

Speaker 6: 
01:03:27-01:03:28
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
01:03:28-01:03:30
Article thirty five, subsection one.

Speaker 1: 
01:03:35-01:03:36
Does that help?

Speaker 6: 
01:03:39-01:03:43
Yes, but it must be that it's pretty subjective.

Speaker 6: 
01:03:45-01:03:58
As in if it's according to the seller's country, if you buy something like the Timu experience or you get a rug that's not up to your standard, but it's up to the standard of

Speaker 6: 
01:03:58-01:04:10
the bo uh sorry the up to the standard of the seller but might not be up to the seller of the up standard of the buyer yes but it's but it's a rug and it's still

Speaker 6: 
01:04:10-01:04:13
Is fit for purpose because it can be used as a rug.

Speaker 6: 
01:04:13-01:04:16
It's just got loose threads and it's a bit crappy.

Speaker 6: 
01:04:16-01:04:22
So it's quality like that, your subjective version of definition of quality.

Speaker 6: 
01:04:22-01:04:23
Does that

Speaker 6: 
01:04:23-01:04:26
come under fitness for purpose or totally separate things?

Speaker 1: 
01:04:27-01:04:31
I would suggest that it would have to be intact and free of defect.

Speaker 6: 
01:04:31-01:04:32
Okay.

Speaker 6: 
01:04:32-01:04:32
Ah, right.

Speaker 6: 
01:04:33-01:04:36
The loose thread would be considered to be a defect.

Speaker 1: 
01:04:36-01:04:38
It's just a little loose thread.

Speaker 1: 
01:04:38-01:04:41
But when we're talking about standards, I'll give you an example.

Speaker 1: 
01:04:42-01:04:46
Which was an example someone gave before, but let's just say I import light fittings.

Speaker 1: 
01:04:46-01:04:46
I did this.

Speaker 1: 
01:04:47-01:04:55
I wanted to buy casing for one light, this what is the spotlight thing that goes in the roof, right?

Speaker 1: 
01:04:57-01:05:04
And I pressed the wrong button on eBay and bought like 300, I kid you not, or 50 or no, a hundred actually.

Speaker 1: 
01:05:06-01:05:13
Of those brackets that the light goes in rather than the actual globe itself.

Speaker 1: 
01:05:15-01:05:17
Turn asked me what I did with them.

Speaker 1: 
01:05:18-01:05:22
So and they were important.

Speaker 1: 
01:05:22-01:05:36
And when I got them, I looked back on the eBay machine thing or wherever I got them from, and it said that these are in keeping with the standards of the jurisdiction in which I bought them

Speaker 1: 
01:05:36-01:05:39
but they were not to be used in other jurisdictions.

Speaker 1: 
01:05:39-01:05:43
And down the bottom it said now this was I was in a moment of weakness.

Speaker 1: 
01:05:44-01:05:49
This and it advised the buyer to actually be aware of

Speaker 1: 
01:05:48-01:05:50
their local regulations.

Speaker 1: 
01:05:50-01:05:52
So that would be more to the point.

Speaker 1: 
01:05:53-01:05:54
Does that help?

Speaker 1: 
01:05:54-01:05:59
Rather than saying, for example, we have these electricity standards

Speaker 1: 
01:05:59-01:06:00
you have these electricity standards.

Speaker 1: 
01:06:01-01:06:02
We're not selling your crappy product.

Speaker 1: 
01:06:03-01:06:05
We're selling your product that meets our standards.

Speaker 1: 
01:06:06-01:06:13
You have to make sure that it meets your standards where you are as opposed to, as you say, a rug that's

Speaker 1: 
01:06:13-01:06:19
That the die is has has um has run or is loose threads or something like that.

Speaker 1: 
01:06:22-01:06:27
The buyer failed to examine the goods for nonconformance, reasonable time.

Speaker 1: 
01:06:27-01:06:34
So in this case, if two weeks can be seen as too long, Stacy may lose her right to claim for nonconformity yet for nonconformity.

Speaker 1: 
01:06:35-01:06:35
Yes.

Speaker 1: 
01:06:35-01:06:39
But there may be a base of other things as well.

Speaker 1: 
01:06:40-01:06:45
And the question of reasonability revolves around what you were stating before.

Speaker 1: 
01:06:45-01:06:47
What is a reasonable time?

Speaker 1: 
01:06:51-01:07:00
And it may be that it may affect her ability or reduce the damages because she could argue that, look

Speaker 1: 
01:06:59-01:07:03
They still do not conform to what we agreed to.

Speaker 1: 
01:07:04-01:07:10
I may have taken two weeks, but in those two weeks, this did not change

Speaker 1: 
01:07:10-01:07:19
From a trumpet to a crap rug, or from a good rug to a bad rug, unless the other party could show

Speaker 1: 
01:07:19-01:07:23
Now I'm just clearly putting in facts here.

Speaker 1: 
01:07:23-01:07:29
The other party could show that when we

Speaker 1: 
01:07:28-01:07:37
delivered the goods to you, you put them in a humid environment because you live now it's getting silly.

Speaker 1: 
01:07:37-01:07:41
You live in a greenhouse

Speaker 1: 
01:07:41-01:07:48
And the humidity changed whatever the quality of the rug was.

Speaker 1: 
01:07:49-01:07:51
Yeah, I don't know how it went there.

Speaker 1: 
01:07:51-01:07:52
Don't write that one.

Speaker 1: 
01:07:53-01:07:55
Did that help at all, Koy?

Speaker 1: 
01:08:01-01:08:02
Oh, well there you go.

Speaker 1: 
01:08:03-01:08:05
Well that's a little peppermis step that I needed.

Speaker 1: 
01:08:06-01:08:08
Any other questions or queries?

Speaker 1: 
01:08:10-01:08:14
Sometimes you run a little bit over, sometimes sometimes you run a little bit over, sometimes maybe not.

Speaker 1: 
01:08:14-01:08:18
So I've got a feeling we're going to either run the timer a little bit over.

Speaker 1: 
01:08:19-01:08:20
Keep on posting.

Speaker 1: 
01:08:21-01:08:23
If you need anything, stay back.

Speaker 1: 
01:08:24-01:08:28
If you want to ask any questions or whatever, or emails, lovely to see you.

Speaker 1: 
01:08:29-01:08:30
Have a good week.

Speaker 1: 
01:08:30-01:08:32
Stay well.

Speaker 1: 
01:08:32-01:08:33
And we'll catch you.
